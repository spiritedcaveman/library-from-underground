Define for any metric space $(X,d)$ the function

d′(x,y)=min⁡{1,d(x,y)}.d'(x,y) = \min\{1, d(x,y)\}.

This defines a new metric $d'$ on $X$ that is **bounded** by $1$, since $d'(x,y) \le 1$ for all $x,y$.

We now show that the identity map $\operatorname{id}: (X,d) \to (X,d')$ is a **homeomorphism**.

- **Continuity** of $\operatorname{id}$:  
	Let $U \subset X$ be open in the $d$-metric. For any $x \in U$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_d(x, \varepsilon) \subset U$. Then for $\delta = \min{\varepsilon,1}$, we have $B_{d'}(x, \delta) \subset B_d(x, \varepsilon) \subset U$, so $U$ is open in $d'$.


- **Inverse continuity**: 
  same reasoning with roles of $d$ and $d'$ swapped.


Hence, the identity map is a homeomorphism.

So every metric space is homeomorphic to one of finite diameter.

Define $E: \mathbb{N} \to \ell^1$ by

$$E(n) = (\underbrace{1,1,\dots,1}_{n}, 0,0,\dots) \in \ell^1.$$Then for $m < n$,

$$\|E(n) - E(m)\|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |E(n)_k - E(m)_k| = \sum_{k=m+1}^{n} 1 = n - m = |n - m|.$$So for all $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$,

$$\|E(n) - E(m)\|_1 = |n - m|.$$Hence, $E$ is an isometric embedding of $(\mathbb{N}, |\cdot|)$ into $(\ell^1, |\cdot|_1)$.

Let
$$
f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2-1}.
$$
This is a homeomorphism from $(-1,1)$ to $\mathbb R$.

Let
$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{1+2^{-x}}.
$$
That is a homeopmorphism from $\mathbb R$ to $(0,1)$.

For any other bounded interval $(a,b)$, just rescale and relocate.

Let $(V, |\cdot|)$ be a normed vector space.

Translation: Define $f(x) = x + y$ for fixed $y \in V$.

Then for all $x_1, x_2 \in V$,

$$\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\| = \|(x_1 + y) - (x_2 + y)\| = \|x_1 - x_2\|.$$So $f$ preserves distances $\Rightarrow f$ is an isometry.

Dilation: Define $g(x) = a x$ for $a \ne 0 \in \mathbb{R}$.

Then $g$ is linear and invertible (inverse: $x \mapsto \tfrac{1}{a}x$).

  

Also,

$$\|g(x) - g(y)\| = \|a(x - y)\| = |a| \cdot \|x - y\|.$$So $g$ is continuous and has continuous inverse $\Rightarrow g$ is a homeomorphism.

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that for each $y \in \mathbb{R}$, the **preimage** $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ has **either 0 or exactly 2 elements**.

Suppose, for contradiction, that $f$ is continuous at all but finitely many points. Then $f$ is continuous on a dense open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}$.

Take any $y$ in the image of $f$. Since $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ has exactly 2 points, say $x_1 < x_2$, and $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y$, by continuity of $f$ near both $x_1$ and $x_2$, the **Intermediate Value Theorem** forces $f$ to take the value $y$ somewhere between $x_1$ and $x_2$ — contradiction, since then $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ would have more than 2 points.

Therefore, at least one of $x_1$ or $x_2$ must be a point of discontinuity. Since $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is a set of size 2 for **infinitely many** such $y$ (otherwise, the image would be finite), and each such $y$ forces at least one discontinuity, $f$ must be discontinuous at **infinitely many points**.
