Show that a set U is open in M if and only if U = f^{-1}(V) for some continuous function f : M \to \mathbb{R} and some open set V in \mathbb{R}.

Suppose $U \subseteq M$ is open. Define $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = d(x, M \setminus U)$, the distance to the closed set $M \setminus U$. Then $f$ is continuous and $f^{-1}((0, \infty)) = U$, since points in $U$ are at a positive distance from the complement.

Conversely, if $U = f^{-1}(V)$ for some continuous $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ and open $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, then $U$ is open as the preimage of an open set under a continuous map.

Suppose that we are given a point $x$ and a sequence $(x_n)$ in a metric space $M$, and suppose that $f(x_n) \to f(x)$ for every continuous, real-valued function $f$ on $M$. Does it follow that $x_n \to x$ in $M$? Explain.


Suppose $x_n \not\to x$ in $M$. Then there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ and a subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ such that $d(x_{n_k}, x) \geq \varepsilon$ for all $k$.

Define $f(y) = d(y, x)$. This function is continuous on $M$ and real-valued. Then $f(x_{n_k}) = d(x_{n_k}, x) \geq \varepsilon$ for all $k$, so $f(x_n) \nrightarrow f(x) = 0$, contradicting the assumption.

Hence, $x_n \to x$ in $M$.

If $F$ is closed and $x \notin F$, show that there are disjoint open sets $U, V$ with $x \in U$ and $F \subset V$. Can $U$ and $V$ be chosen so that $\overline{U}$ and $\overline{V}$ are disjoint?

Since $F$ is closed and $x \notin F$, define $d = \inf{d(x, y) : y \in F} > 0$.

Let $U = B(x, d/3)$ and for each $y \in F$, choose $V_y = B(y, d/3)$. Then ${V_y}_{y \in F}$ is an open cover of $F$. Let $V = \bigcup_{y \in F} V_y$, which is open and contains $F$.

Then $U \cap V = \emptyset$, since for $z \in U$, $d(z,x) < d/3$ and for $w \in V_y$, $d(w,y) < d/3$ ⇒ $d(z,w) \ge d - 2d/3 = d/3 > 0$.

So $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, open, $x \in U$, $F \subset V$.

Now choose $U = B(x, \tfrac{d}{4})$ and $V = \bigcup_{y \in F} B(y, \tfrac{d}{4})$.

Then $\overline{U} \subset B(x, \tfrac{d}{4} + \delta) \subset B(x, \tfrac{d}{3})$ for small $\delta$, and similarly $\overline{V} \subset B(y, \tfrac{d}{3})$ for each $y$, hence disjoint from $\overline{U}$.

Thus, $\overline{U} \cap \overline{V} = \emptyset$.

In conclusion metric spaces are regular

Given disjoint nonempty closed sets $E, F$, define $f : M \to \mathbb{R}$ by $$ f(x) = \frac{d(x, E)}{d(x, E) + d(x, F)}. $$ Show that $f$ is a continuous function on $M$ with $0 \le f \le 1$, $f^{-1}(\{0\}) = E$, and $f^{-1}(\{1\}) = F$. Use this to find disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $E \subset U$ and $F \subset V$. Can $U$ and $V$ be chosen so that $\overline{U}$ and $\overline{V}$ are disjoint?


Since $E$ and $F$ are nonempty closed and disjoint, $d(x,E), d(x,F) > 0$ for all $x \notin E \cup F$, and $d(x,E)$, $d(x,F)$ are continuous on $M$. So $f(x)$ is the ratio of continuous functions where the denominator is never zero. Hence $f$ is continuous on $M$.

Note:

- If $x \in E$, then $d(x,E) = 0$, $d(x,F) > 0$ ⇒ $f(x) = 0$.
    
- If $x \in F$, then $d(x,F) = 0$, $d(x,E) > 0$ ⇒ $f(x) = 1$.
    
- For $x \notin E \cup F$, both distances are positive ⇒ $0 < f(x) < 1$.
    

So $0 \le f \le 1$, with $f^{-1}({0}) = E$ and $f^{-1}({1}) = F$.

To separate $E$ and $F$, define:

- $U = f^{-1}([0, \tfrac{1}{2}))$ (open, contains $E$),
    
- $V = f^{-1}((\tfrac{1}{2}, 1])$ (open, contains $F$).
    

Then $U \cap V = \emptyset$, $E \subset U$, $F \subset V$.

Since $\overline{U} \subset f^{-1}([0, \tfrac{1}{2}])$ and $\overline{V} \subset f^{-1}([\tfrac{1}{2}, 1])$, the closures are disjoint.

Show that every open set in $M$ is the union of countably many closed sets, and that every closed set is the intersection of countably many open sets.


Let $U \subset M$ be open. For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define
$$F_n = \left\{x \in M : \overline{B(x, \tfrac{1}{n})} \subset U \right\}.$$
Each $F_n$ is closed: it is the preimage of a closed set under the map $x \mapsto \overline{B(x, 1/n)}$, and $\overline{B(x, 1/n)} \subset U$ is closed under containment.
Then $F_n \supset F_{n+1}$, and $\bigcup_{n} F_n = U$.

Now let $F \subset M$ be closed. Then $U = M \setminus F$ is open. Define
$$G_n = \left\{x \in M : d(x,F) > \tfrac{1}{n} \right\}.$$Each $G_n$ is open, and $G_n \supset G_{n+1}$, so$$\bigcap_{n} G_n = M \setminus F = U.$$
Hence $F = \bigcap_{n} (M \setminus G_n)$ is the intersection of countably many open sets.

We define the distance between two nonempty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $M$ by $d(A, B) = \inf\{d(a, b) : a \in A, b \in B\}$. Give an example of two disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $d(A, B) = 0$.



* $A = \{(x, 0) : x > 0\} \cup \{(0, y) : y \ge 0\}$

* $B = \{(x, 1/x) : x > 0\}$


* $A$ is closed: it includes the point $(0,0)$, which is the limit of $(x,0)$ and lies in the vertical ray too.

* $B$ is closed: it's the graph of a continuous function over $(0, \infty)$ with no limit point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ outside itself.

* $A \cap B = \emptyset$

* But $d(A,B) = 0$ since $(x,0) \in A$ and $(x,1/x) \in B$ get arbitrarily close as $x \to \infty$.

Let $C$ be a closed set in $\mathbb{R}$ and let $f: C \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. Show that there is a continuous function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $g(x) = f(x)$ for every $x \in C$. We say that $g$ is a continuous extension of $f$ to all of $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, every continuous function on the Cantor set $\Delta$ extends continuously to all of $\mathbb{R}$. ($\textit{Hint}$: The complement of $C$ is the countable union of disjoint open intervals. Define $g$ by "connecting the dots" across each of these open intervals.)


Since $C \subset \mathbb{R}$ is closed, its complement $U = \mathbb{R} \setminus C$ is open, and can be written as a countable disjoint union of open intervals:

$$U = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (a_n, b_n),$$

where each $(a_n, b_n)$ is maximal and disjoint, and $a_n, b_n \in C$ (since $C$ is closed).

Define $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by:

$g(x) = f(x)$ for $x \in C$,

On each open interval $(a_n, b_n)$, define $g$ by linear interpolation:

$$g(x) = f(a_n) + \frac{f(b_n) - f(a_n)}{b_n - a_n}(x - a_n), \quad x \in (a_n, b_n).$$

This defines $g$ on all of $\mathbb{R}$. Each piece is continuous, and on the boundary of each interval $g$ matches $f$ at $a_n$ and $b_n$, so $g$ is continuous at those endpoints as well.

Hence, $g$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ and extends $f$.

In particular, this applies to the Cantor set $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}$, which is closed. Any $f: \Delta \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous extends to a continuous $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.

Suppose that $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz. Show that $f$ extends to a continuous function $h: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Is $h$ unique? Explain. ($\textit{Hint}$: Given $x \in \mathbb{R}$, choose a sequence of rationals $(r_n)$ converging to $x$ and argue that $h(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(r_n)$ exists and is actually independent of the sequence $(r_n)$.)

Let $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lipschitz:

$$|f(q_1) - f(q_2)| \le L |q_1 - q_2| \quad \forall q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{Q}.$$Given $x \in \mathbb{R}$, choose any sequence $(r_n) \subset \mathbb{Q}$ with $r_n \to x$. Since $f$ is Lipschitz, the sequence $(f(r_n))$ is Cauchy:$$|f(r_n) - f(r_m)| \le L |r_n - r_m| \to 0 \quad \text{as } n, m \to \infty.$$

So $\lim f(r_n)$ exists.

Suppose $(s_n) \to x$ is another sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$. Then

$$|f(r_n) - f(s_n)| \le L |r_n - s_n| \to 0,$$

so both sequences have the same limit. Define $h(x) := \lim f(r_n)$.

Then $h$ is well-defined on $\mathbb{R}$, and for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$, taking constant sequence $r_n = x$, we have $h(x) = f(x)$. So $h$ extends $f$.

For continuity, let $x_n \to x$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Choose rationals $r_n$ with $|x_n - r_n| < \tfrac{1}{n}$. Then $r_n \to x$, so $h(x_n) \approx f(r_n) \to h(x)$, showing $h$ is continuous.

Uniqueness: any continuous extension of $f$ must agree with $h$ on a dense subset and be continuous, so by density and continuity, it must be equal to $h$ on all of $\mathbb{R}$.

Thus, $h$ exists, is continuous, and is unique.
