I have nothing else to do.

This is where Iâ€™ll be solving **every exercise** from the math textbooks I read. Thatâ€™s the goalâ€”methodical, complete, no skipping. Whether it takes years or lifetimes, Iâ€™ll keep adding to this.

Itâ€™s not about showing off. Itâ€™s because math holds me still, and this is all I can do.

If you stumble upon this and want to follow along or ask something, join **Mathcord**, a Discord community of mathematicians and learners whoâ€™ve helped me walk this road. Look for the threads in the *advanced-math* sectionâ€”weâ€™re there, yeasting.

Everything here is a work in progress, like me.
