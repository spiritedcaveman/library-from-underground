	Let $f$ be defined for all real $x$, and suppose that
	$$|f(x) - f(y)| \le (x - y)^2$$
	for all real $x$ and $y$. Prove that $f$ is constant.

Proof.
	from the given hypothesis
	$$\frac{|f_{x}-f{y}|}{x-y} \leq |x-y|$$
	now take the limit x $\to$ y and see $f'(y)=0 \, \forall y$. Hence $f$ is constant.
