diagonal matrices don't form normal subgroup inside upper triangular

diag nondiag will result into non diag


1.8.

**(a) True.**  
Let $A$ be real symmetric and non-negative definite. Then $x^T A x \geq 0$ for all $x$. Since $A$ is symmetric, it's diagonalizable: $A = Q \Lambda Q^T$ with $\Lambda = \operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)$.  
Then $x^T A x = y^T \Lambda y = \sum \lambda_i y_i^2 \geq 0$ for all $y = Q^T x$.  
So all $\lambda_i \geq 0$.

**(b) True.**  
If $A$ symmetric with eigenvalues $\lambda_i \geq 0$, then for $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$,  
$x^T A x = x^T Q \Lambda Q^T x = y^T \Lambda y = \sum \lambda_i y_i^2 \geq 0$.

**(c) True.**  
$A A^T$ is symmetric: $(A A^T)^T = A A^T$.  
For any $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$,  
$x^T A A^T x = (A^T x)^T (A^T x) = |A^T x|^2 \geq 0$.

**symmetric matrices are diagonalisable**








Exactly — you're referring to a classical result:

Let $A, B \subseteq X$ in a metric space $(X,d)$. Then:

> **$d(A, B) > 0 \iff \bar{A} \cap \bar{B} = \emptyset$ if $A$ is closed and $B$ is compact.**

This holds because compactness of $B$ ensures the infimum is **attained** and cannot approach 0 unless the closures intersect. Without compactness, $d(A,B) > 0$ does **not** follow just from disjoint closures.

So for your updated **(a)**:

> **(a)** If $A$ is closed, $B$ is compact, and $\bar{A} \cap \bar{B} = \emptyset$, then $d(A,B) > 0$ — **True** and in fact **iff**.
> 


without compactness let's take $\{0 \}$ and $\{\frac{1}{n} \}$ both closed so the closure remains empty but the distance approaches zero
