if a representation is reducible, you can break the space into invariant subspaces and define a projection to one of them. This projection commutes with the action of $G$ but is **not scalar**. So irreducibility means such non-scalar projections don't exist.

**any** operator commuting with all $r(g)$ must preserve all $G$-invariant subspaces. If there are none, the operator can only be scalar.

if $A$ commutes with all $r(g)$, then $A$ is diagonalizable in the same basis that makes $r(g)$ nice (i.e., simultaneous diagonalization if possible). But if $A = \lambda I$, it trivially commutes with everything. And the claim is: in irreducible representations, this is the **only** kind of $A$ that works.



Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a finite abelian group.
Let $V$ be a non-null vector space over an algebraically closed field $K$.
Let $\rho: G \to \text{GL}(V)$ be a linear representation.

Then $\rho$ is irreducible if and only if $\text{dim}_K(V)=1$, where $\text{dim}_K$ denotes dimension.


The four irreducible $\mathbb{C}G$-modules for $G = C_2 \times C_2 = \langle g_1, g_2 \rangle$ are $V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4$, where $V_i$ is a 1-dimensional space with basis $v_i$ ($i = 1, 2, 3, 4$) and
$$\begin{align} v_1 g_1 &= v_1, & v_1 g_2 &= v_1; \\ v_2 g_1 &= v_2, & v_2 g_2 &= -v_2; \\ v_3 g_1 &= -v_3, & v_3 g_2 &= v_3; \\ v_4 g_1 &= -v_4, & v_4 g_2 &= -v_4. \end{align}$$
