Definiton of known things in term of the module structure

(1) The trivial $FG$-module is the 1-dimensional vector space $V$ over $F$ with
$$vg = v \quad \text{for all } v \in V, g \in G.$$

(2) An $FG$-module $V$ is faithful if the identity element of $G$ is the only element $g$ for which
$$vg = v \quad \text{for all } v \in V.$$


Definition
Let $G$ be a subgroup of $S_n$. The $FG$-module $V$ with basis $v_1, \dots, v_n$ such that
$$v_i g = v_{ig}$$
for all $i$, and all $g \in G$,
is called the permutation module for $G$ over $F$. We call $v_1, \dots, v_n$ the natural basis of $V$.




Let $G$ be a group and $F$ a field.

Then the **group algebra** $FG$ is a ring, and any representation $\rho : G \to \text{GL}(V)$ gives $V$ the structure of a **left $FG$-module**, where:

* You define the action of each $g \in G$ on $v \in V$ as $v \cdot g := \rho(g)(v)$
* Extend this linearly over all of $FG$

So the map
$$FG \times V \to V$$
given by $(\sum a_g g, v) \mapsto \sum a_g \rho(g)(v)$
makes $V$ an $FG$-module **exactly when** the representation $\rho$ respects the group structure (i.e. $\rho(gh) = \rho(g)\rho(h)$).
