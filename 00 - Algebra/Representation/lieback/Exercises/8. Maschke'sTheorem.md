Let $G = \langle x : x^3 = 1 \rangle \cong C_3$, and let $V$ be the 2-dimensional $\mathbb{C}G$-module with basis $v_1, v_2$, where
$$v_1x = v_2, \quad v_2x = -v_1 - v_2.$$(This is a CG-module, by Exercise 3.2.)
Express $V$ as a direct sum of irreducible $\mathbb{C}G$-submodules.

$$
C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
$$



Let $u = v_1 - \omega v_2$, $w = v_1 - \omega^2 v_2$.

Then $u x = \omega u$, $w x = \omega^2 w$ ⇒ $V = \mathbb{C}u \oplus \mathbb{C}w$.

These are $G$-invariant and irreducible. So final decomposition:


$$V = \mathbb{C}(v_1 - \omega v_2) \oplus \mathbb{C}(v_1 - \omega^2 v_2)$$

# 2.

If $G = C_2 \times C_2$, express the group algebra $\mathbb{R}G$ as a direct sum of 1-dimensional $\mathbb{R}G$-submodules.

Let $G = C_2 \times C_2 = {1, g_1, g_2, g_1g_2}$, with $g_i^2 = 1$. Since $G$ is abelian and $|G| = 4$, its group algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ is semisimple and decomposes as a direct sum of simple modules.

The character table over $\mathbb{R}$ shows four 1-dimensional real irreducible representations, corresponding to the four homomorphisms $G \to {\pm1}$. Define idempotents:

$$e_\chi = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \chi(g^{-1})g$$

for each character $\chi$. These $e_\chi$ are primitive orthogonal idempotents summing to 1.

Then:

RG=Re1⊕Re2⊕Re3⊕Re4\mathbb{R}G = \mathbb{R}e_1 \oplus \mathbb{R}e_2 \oplus \mathbb{R}e_3 \oplus \mathbb{R}e_4

Each $\mathbb{R}e_i$ is a 1-dimensional $\mathbb{R}G$-submodule. Thus, $\mathbb{R}G$ is the direct sum of four 1-dimensional submodules.

Find a group $G$, a $\mathbb{C}G$-module $V$ and a $\mathbb{C}G$-homomorphism $\psi: V \to V$ such that $V \neq \text{Ker } \psi \oplus \text{Im } \psi$.

# 4.

Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\rho: G \to \text{GL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ be a representation of $G$. Suppose that there are elements $g, h$ in $G$ such that the matrices $\rho(g)$ and $\rho(h)$ do not commute. Prove that $\rho$ is irreducible.
(You may care to revisit Example 5.5(2) and Exercises 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 6.6 in the light of this result.)


Suppose $\rho$ is **reducible**, then there exists a 1-dimensional $\mathbb{C}G$-submodule $W \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ invariant under all $\rho(g)$, i.e., a common eigenspace preserved by every $\rho(g)$. That is, all $\rho(g)$ are simultaneously triangularizable (via conjugation, all lie in upper-triangular form).

But then **all** $\rho(g)$ would commute (since upper-triangular matrices that preserve a common 1-dimensional subspace commute). This contradicts the assumption that $\rho(g)$ and $\rho(h)$ do **not** commute. Therefore, no such invariant subspace exists, and $\rho$ is irreducible.

Suppose that $G$ is the infinite group
$$\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ n & 1 \end{pmatrix} : n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$$
and let $V$ be the $\mathbb{C}G$-module $\mathbb{C}^2$, with the natural multiplication by elements of $G$ (so that for $v \in V$, $g \in G$, the vector $vg$ is just the product of the row vector $v$ with the matrix $g$).
Show that $V$ is not completely reducible.
(**This shows that Maschke's Theorem fails for infinite groups compare - Example 8.2(2).**)

An alternative proof of Maschke's Theorem for $\mathbb{C}G$-modules.

Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{C}G$-module with basis $v_1, \dots, v_n$ and suppose that $U$ is a $\mathbb{C}G$-submodule of $V$. Define a complex inner product $( \cdot, \cdot )$ on $V$ as follows: for $\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i v_i, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j v_j \in V$,
$$\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i v_i, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j v_j \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \overline{\mu_i}.$$Define another complex inner product $[ \cdot, \cdot ]$ on $V$ by$$[u, v] = \sum_{x \in G} (ux, vx) \quad (u, v \in V).$$(1) Verify that $[ \cdot, \cdot ]$ is a complex inner product, which satisfies$$[ug, vg] = [u, v] \text{ for all } u, v \in V \text{ and } g \in G.$$

(1) The form $[\cdot,\cdot]$ is sesquilinear, conjugate symmetric, and positive definite because it is a finite sum of inner products: for any $u,v \in V$, $[u,v] = \sum_{x \in G} (ux,vx)$ is linear in the first variable and conjugate-linear in the second. Also, $[v,v] = \sum_{x \in G} (vx,vx) \ge 0$ with equality iff $vx = 0$ for all $x$, i.e., $v = 0$, since $G$ acts linearly and $V$ is finite-dimensional. Thus, $[\cdot,\cdot]$ is a valid complex inner product. Moreover, for all $g \in G$,

$$
[ug,vg]=∑x∈G(ugx,vgx)=∑y=gx∈G(uy,vy)=[u,v][ug, vg] = \sum_{x \in G} (ugx, vgx) = \sum_{y = gx \in G} (uy, vy) = [u, v]
$$

since $G$ is a finite group and left multiplication is a bijection on $G$.



(2) Suppose that $U$ is a $\mathbb{C}G$-submodule of $V$, and define$$U^\perp = \{ v \in V : [u, v] = 0 \text{ for all } u \in U \}.$$
Show that $U^\perp$ is a $\mathbb{C}G$-submodule of $V$.


(2) Let $v \in U^\perp$, and let $g \in G$. For any $u \in U$, since $U$ is a $\mathbb{C}G$-submodule, $ug^{-1} \in U$, and:

$$
[u,vg]=[ug−1,v]=0[u, vg] = [ug^{-1}, v] = 0
$$

because $v \in U^\perp$ and $ug^{-1} \in U$. Hence, $vg \in U^\perp$, so $U^\perp$ is stable under $G$. Since $U^\perp$ is clearly a subspace, it is a $\mathbb{C}G$-submodule.



(3) Deduce Maschke's Theorem. (Hint: it is a standard property of complex inner products that $V = U \oplus U^\perp$ for all subspaces $U$ of $V$.)



(3) Since $[\cdot,\cdot]$ is a complex inner product, the standard Hilbert space result applies: $V = U \oplus U^\perp$ as a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces. Since both $U$ and $U^\perp$ are $\mathbb{C}G$-submodules, $V$ is a direct sum of submodules, proving that every submodule has a $G$-invariant complement. This is exactly Maschke’s Theorem.


# 7.

Prove that for every finite simple group $G$, there exists a faithful irreducible $\mathbb{C}G$-module.


Since $G$ is finite, the group algebra $\mathbb{C}G$ is semisimple (by Maschke’s Theorem), so $G$ has finitely many irreducible representations over $\mathbb{C}$, say $\rho_1, \dots, \rho_n$.

Let $\rho = \rho_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \rho_n$ be the regular representation; it is faithful because the action of $G$ on itself by left multiplication separates group elements (i.e., $\ker \rho = {1}$).

Each $\rho_i$ is irreducible. Now suppose all the $\rho_i$ are non-faithful. Then for each $i$, $\ker \rho_i$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$; since $G$ is simple, $\ker \rho_i = G$ or $1$. But if $\rho_i$ is non-faithful, then $\ker \rho_i = G$, so $\rho_i$ is trivial. But there is only one trivial representation. So all but one summand would be zero, contradicting the fact that the regular representation has dimension $|G|$.

Hence, at least one irreducible representation must have trivial kernel, i.e., is **faithful**. So $G$ has a **faithful irreducible** $\mathbb{C}G$-module.



The **kernel of any representation** $\rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ is indeed a normal subgroup of $G$.

Now suppose $N \trianglelefteq G$ is a normal subgroup. Then $N$ is the intersection of the kernels of all irreducible constituents of the regular representation — this is always true. So every normal subgroup is the intersection of kernels of (possibly many) irreducible representations.

But now, for a finite **simple** group $G$, the only normal subgroups are ${1}$ and $G$. So if some irreducible representation $\rho$ had $\ker \rho \ne {1}$, it must be the whole group, i.e., $\rho$ is trivial.

So all **nontrivial irreducible representations** of $G$ must be **faithful**, because otherwise the kernel would be $G$, which contradicts simplicity (we only want trivial representation to have full kernel).

Now, the only remaining question is: **do there exist any nontrivial irreducible representations at all?** The answer is yes, because:

- The number of irreducible representations of $G$ equals the number of conjugacy classes, and
    
- $G$ is nontrivial ⇒ more than one class ⇒ more than one irreducible representation ⇒ at least one nontrivial irreducible representation.
    

Thus, at least one irreducible representation is **faithful**.
