If _R_ is commutative, a nonzero ideal _I_ of _R_ is free if and only if it is a [principal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal "Principal ideal") generated by a [nonzerodivisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzerodivisor "Nonzerodivisor"), with a generator being a basis.

Let $I$ be a nonzero free $R$-module. Then $I$ has a basis ${x_j}$, so any $r \in I$ can be written uniquely as a finite sum $r = \sum r_j x_j$ with $r_j \in R$. Since $I$ is an ideal, for any $r \in R$ and any $x_j, x_k$, the product $x_j x_k \in I$, so it must be expressible uniquely as a linear combination of the basis elements. But $x_j x_k = x_k x_j$ lies in the span of both $x_j$ and $x_k$, implying a nontrivial linear relation unless the basis has size 1. Thus, $I$ has rank 1: $I = Rx$ for some $x \ne 0$.

If $x$ is a zerodivisor, then there exists $r \ne 0$ with $rx = 0$, but this contradicts $Rx$ being free: $rx = 0$ implies $r = 0$ in a free module. Hence, $x$ must be a nonzerodivisor, and $I = Rx$ with $x$ a basis. Conversely, if $I = Rx$ with $x$ a nonzerodivisor, then the map $R \to I$, $r \mapsto rx$ is an isomorphism of $R$-modules, hence $I$ is free with basis ${x}$.

**Example 1 (Free ideal = principal ideal generated by nonzerodivisor):**  
Let $R = \mathbb{Z}$, and take the ideal $I = 3\mathbb{Z}$. Then $I$ is free of rank 1 with basis ${3}$. The generator $3$ is a nonzerodivisor in $\mathbb{Z}$, so $I$ satisfies the criterion.

**Example 2 (Principal ideal generated by zerodivisor ≠ free):**  
Let $R = \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$, and consider the ideal $I = (2)$. Then $2 \cdot 3 = 0$, so $2$ is a zerodivisor. The map $R \to I$, $r \mapsto 2r$ is not injective, so $I$ is not free.

---

**Example 3 (Ideal not principal ⇒ not free):**  
Let $R = k[x,y]$, a polynomial ring over a field $k$. The ideal $I = (x, y)$ is not principal and not free as an $R$-module (though it's projective in some localizations). So it fails the criterion.

These examples show:

- Only principal ideals generated by nonzerodivisors can be free.
    
- Others (non-principal or generated by zerodivisors) are not free.

  - A finitely generated module over a commutative [local ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ring "Local ring") is free if and only if it is [faithfully flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_module#Faithful_flatness "Flat module").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_module#cite_note-4) Also, [Kaplansky's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplansky%27s_theorem_on_projective_modules "Kaplansky's theorem on projective modules") states a projective module over a (possibly non-commutative) local ring is free.

$$\bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i = \left\{ (m_i) \in \prod M_i \mid m_i = 0 \text{ for all but finitely many } i \right\}$$

$$
\prod M_i = \left\{ (m_i) \mid m_{i} \in M_{i} \,\text{for all} \,i\right\}
$$
they are same if $I$ is finite
