intersection of all maximal ideal

If $(a)=R$, then $1\in (a)$. In particular, $ra=1$ for some $r\in R$, and thus $a$ is a unit.


the sum of an element of rad($R$) and a unit is a unit

If $a$ is not a unit then $aR$ is a proper right ideal of $R$, so there is a maximal right ideal $m$ with $aR \subset m$. But then $a \in m$, and $x \in J(R) \subset m$ since $J(R)$ is the intersection of all the maximal right ideals, so $u \in m$, but $u$ is a unit, which contradicts $m$ being a maximal ideal.

 $\mathfrak{a} \subset rad(R)$ if $1 − \mathfrak{a} ⊂ R^\times.$
 
 

Let $a \in \mathfrak{a}$. Then $1 - a \in R^\times$ by assumption.
Let $M$ be any maximal ideal of $R$. Since $1 - a$ is a unit, its image in $R/M$ is nonzero, so $a \notin M$ would imply $1 - a \equiv 1 \pmod{M}$ is a unit $\Rightarrow$ contradiction. Hence, $a \in M$.
Since $a$ lies in every maximal ideal, $a \in \operatorname{rad}(R)$.

Because $1 - \mathfrak{a} \subset R^\times$, so for $a \in \mathfrak{a}$, we have $1 - a \in R^\times$ directly.


 **Let $A$ be a ring, $n$ the set of non-units. Then $A$ is local if and only if $n$ is an ideal; if so, then $n$ is the maximal ideal.**
