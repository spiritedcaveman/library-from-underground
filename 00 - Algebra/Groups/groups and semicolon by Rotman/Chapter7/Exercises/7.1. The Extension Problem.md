If $K$ and $Q$ are finite, then every extension $G$ of $K$ by $Q$ has order $|K||Q|$. If $G$ has a normal series with factor groups $Q_n, \dots, Q_1$, then $|G| = \prod_{i=1}^n |Q_i|$.

Proof.
Let
$$1 = K_0 \triangleleft K_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft K_n = G$$be a normal series for $G$ with factor groups $Q_i = K_i/K_{i-1}$. Each $Q_i$ is a quotient group, so$$|K_i| = |K_{i-1}||Q_i| \quad \text{for each } i.$$By induction,$$|G| = |K_n| = \prod_{i=1}^n |Q_i|.$$If $G$ is an extension of $K$ by $Q$, then $|G| = |K||Q|$ follows from the short exact sequence$$1 \to K \to G \to Q \to 1.$$

(i) Show that $A_4$ is an extension of $V$ by $\mathbb{Z}_3$.

In $A_4$, the Klein four-group $V = \{ (), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23) \}$ is a normal subgroup because it is the unique subgroup of order 4 and is closed under conjugation within $A_4$. Since $|A_4| = 12$ and $|V| = 4$, the quotient $A_4/V$ has order 3. Therefore, $A_4/V \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$, showing that $A_4$ is an extension of $V$ by $\mathbb{Z}_3$.

$$1 \to V \to A_{4} \to{\phi} \Bbb{Z_{3}} \to 1$$


(ii) Find all the extensions of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ by $V$.

$$1 \to \Bbb{Z_{3}} \to G \xrightarrow{\phi} V  \to 1$$

$(\mathbb{Z}_3 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2) \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \cong S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$.

 If $p$ is prime, every nonabelian group of order $p^3$ is an extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ by $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$. (Hint. Exercise 4.7.)
Soln.
 If $p$ is a prime and $G$ is a nonabelian group of order $p^3$, then $|Z(G)| = p$, $G/Z(G) \cong Z_p \times Z_p$, and $Z(G) = G'$, the commutator subgroup.
 
Proof.
Let $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $p^3$, with $p$ prime. Then possible orders for $Z(G)$ are $p$, $p^2$, or $p^3$.

- If $|Z(G)| = p^3$, then $Z(G) = G$, so $G$ is abelian — contradiction.
- If $|Z(G)| = p^2$, then $|G/Z(G)| = p$, which is cyclic. But then $G$ itself is abelian — again contradiction.
Therefore, $|Z(G)| = p$ is the only possibility.
So $|G/Z(G)| = p^2$, and since $G$ is nonabelian, $G/Z(G)$ is not cyclic. Hence:
$$G/Z(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p.$$

$$1 \to \Bbb{Z}_p \to G \to \left( \Bbb{Z}_p \right)^2 \to 1$$

# 7.4.
 Give an example of an extension of $K$ by $Q$ that does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to $Q$.

Soln.
$$1 \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \to Q_8 \to V_4 \to 1,$$
where $\mathbb{Z}_2 = Z(Q_8) = \{ \pm 1 \}$ and $Q_8 = \{\pm1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$ is the quaternion group.
Then $Q_8 / Z(Q_8) \cong V_4$, the Klein four-group. However, $V_4$ is not isomorphic to any subgroup of $Q_8$: there is no subgroup of $Q_8$ isomorphic to $V_4$, since all its proper nontrivial subgroups are cyclic of order $4$ or $2$.
So this is an extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ by $V_4$ that does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to $V_4$.

If $(a, b) = 1$ and $K$ and $Q$ are abelian groups of orders $a$ and $b$, respectively, then there is only one (to isomorphism) abelian extension of $K$ by $Q$.

 Which of the following properties, when enjoyed by both $K$ and $Q$, is also enjoyed by every extension of $K$ by $Q$? (i) finite; (ii) $p$-group; (iii) abelian; (iv) cyclic; (v) solvable; (vi) nilpotent; (vii) ACC; (viii) DCC; (ix) periodic (every element has finite order); (x) torsion-free (every element other than 1 has infinite order).
