# 7.41.
Use the Schur-Zassenhaus lemma and Exercise 7.29 to reclassify all groups of order $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes.


# 7.42.
 Prove that every group of order $p^2q$, where $p > q$ are primes, has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup, and classify all such groups.



# 7.43.
 Using Lemma 4.23, reclassify all groups of order 12.



# 7.44.
Use factor sets to prove the existence of the generalized quaternions $Q_{2^n}$. (Hint. Exercise 4.42.)
