Show that $A_n$, the set of all even permutations in $S_n$, is a subgroup with $n!/2$ elements. ($A_n$ is called the alternating group on $n$ letters.) (Hint. Exercise 1.21.)

Since $S_n$ is a group, we apply the subgroup test to $A_n$. The identity permutation is even, so $e \in A_n$. For $\sigma, \tau \in A_n$, we have $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) = \operatorname{sgn}(\tau) = 1$, so $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma \tau) = 1$, implying $\sigma \tau \in A_n$. Also, $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma^{-1}) = \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) = 1$, so $\sigma^{-1} \in A_n$, proving $A_n$ is a subgroup. Since exactly half of the elements in $S_n$ are even, $|A_n| = \frac{n!}{2}$.

If $\mathbb{K}$ is a field, show that $\operatorname{SL}(n, \mathbb{K})$, the set of all $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{K}$ having determinant $1$, is a subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}(n, \mathbb{K})$. ($\operatorname{SL}(n, \mathbb{K})$ is called the special linear group over $\mathbb{K}$.)

Since $GL(n, k)$ is a group under matrix multiplication, we apply the subgroup test to $SL(n, k)$. For $A, B \in SL(n, k)$, we have $\det(A) = \det(B) = 1$, and since determinant is multiplicative, $\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B) = 1$, so $AB \in SL(n, k)$. Also, for $A \in SL(n, k)$, $\det(A^{-1}) = (\det A)^{-1} = 1$, so $A^{-1} \in SL(n, k)$. Since $I \in SL(n, k)$, the subgroup test is satisfied, proving $SL(n, k) \le GL(n, k)$.

The set theoretic union of two subgroups is a subgroup if and only if one is contained in the other. Is this true if we replace "two subgroups" by "three subgroups"?

If $H \subseteq K$ or $K \subseteq H$, then $H \cup K = K$ or $H \cup K = H$, so $H \cup K$ is a subgroup.

Conversely, if $H \cup K$ is a subgroup and $H \nsubseteq K$, then there is $h \in H \setminus K$. For any $k \in K$, $hk \in H \cup K$. If $hk \in H$, then $k = h^{-1}hk \in H$, a contradiction. Thus, $hk \in K$, so $h^{-1}hk = k \in K$, hence $H \cup K \subseteq K$ and $H\subseteq K$.

Let $S$ be a proper subgroup of $G$. If $G - S$ is the complement of $S$, prove that $\langle G - S \rangle = G$.

Since $S$ is a proper subgroup, there exists $g \in G \setminus S$. The subgroup $\langle G \setminus S \rangle$ contains all products of elements from $G \setminus S$ and their inverses. If $\langle G \setminus S \rangle \neq G$, then it is a proper subgroup of $G$ containing $G \setminus S$, contradicting the assumption that $S$ is maximal with respect to exclusion from $G$.

If $H = \langle G \setminus S \rangle$ is a proper subgroup, then $H \subsetneq G$ and $S \subsetneq H^c$. But $H$ contains all elements of $G \setminus S$, so $S \subseteq H$, implying $H = G$, contradicting $H \neq G$. Hence $H \cup K \subseteq K$ and $H\subseteq K$.

Let $f: G \rightarrow H$ and $g: G \rightarrow H$ be homomorphisms, and let
$$K = \{a \in G: f(a) = g(a)\}$$
Must $K$ be a subgroup of $G$?

Yes, $K$ is a subgroup since $e \in K$, and for $a, b \in K$, we have $f(a) = g(a)$ and $f(b) = g(b)$; $f(b^{-1}) = f(b)^{-1}, \quad g(b^{-1}) = g(b)^{-1}$

so, $f(ab^{-1}) = f(a)f(b^{-1}) = g(a)g(b^{-1}) = g(ab^{-1})$,
implying $ab^{-1} \in K$.

Suppose that $X$ is a nonempty subset of a set $Y$. Show that $S_X$ can be **imbedded** in $S_Y$; that is, $S_X$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_Y$. 

Define the embedding $\phi: S_X \rightarrow S_Y$ by extending each $\sigma \in S_X$ to $Y$ by fixing all $y \in Y \setminus X$. This is a well-defined injective homomorphism, so $S_X$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_Y$.

If $n > 2$, then $A_n$ is generated by all the 3-cycles. (Hint. $(ij)(jk) = (ijk)$ and $(ij)(kl) = (ijk)(ijl)$.)

Every even permutation in $A_n$ is a product of an even number of transpositions.
$$(ij)(jk) = (ijk) \text{and} (ij)(kl) = (ijk)(jkl)$$
Thus, a product of an even number of transpositions can be rewritten as a product of 3-cycles by pairing adjacent transpositions.\\
By iterating this process, any even permutation can be expressed as a product of 3-cycles. Hence, the 3-cycles generate $A_n$.

Imbed $S_n$ as a subgroup of $A_{n+2}$, but show, for $n \ge 2$, that $S_n$ cannot be imbedded in $A_{n+1}$.

Define an embedding $\phi: S_n \rightarrow A_{n+2}$ by
$$\phi(\sigma) = \sigma (n+1\ n+2)$$
for all $\sigma \in S_n$. Since $(n+1\ n+2)$ is an odd permutation, the composition $\sigma (n+1\ n+2)$ is even, ensuring $\phi(S_n) \subseteq A_{n+2}$.
The map $\phi$ is injective since $\phi(\sigma) = \phi(\tau)$ implies $\sigma = \tau$. Hence, $S_n$ is \textcolor{red}{imbedded} (embedded as a subgroup) in $A_{n+2}$.

(i) Prove that $S_n$ can be generated by $(1 \ 2)$, $(1 \ 3)$, \dots, $(1 \ n)$. (ii) Prove that $S_n$ can be generated by $(1 \ 2)$, $(2 \ 3)$, \dots, $(i \ i+1)$, \dots, $(n-1 \ n)$. (iii) Prove that $S_n$ can be generated by the two elements $(1 \ 2)$ and $(1 \ 2 \dots n)$. (iv) Prove that $S_n$ cannot be generated by $(1 \ 3)$ and $(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)$. (Thus, $S_n$ can be generated by a transposition and a 4-cycle, but not every choice of transposition and 4-cycle gives a generating set.)
