neither $H$ nor $K$ is a subgroup of $H \times K$,
but $H \times K$ does contain isomorphic replicas of each, namely, $H \times \{1\} = \{(h, 1) : h \in H\}$ and $\{1\} \times K = \{(1, k) : k \in K\}$.

(i) $(h, 1) \in H \times \{1\}$ and $(1, k) \in \{1\} \times K$ commute.
(ii) $H \times \{1\}$ and $\{1\} \times K$ are normal subgroups of $H \times K$.
(iii) $(H \times \{1\}) \cap (\{1\} \times K) = \{(1,1)\}$ and $(H \times \{1\})(\{1\} \times K) = H \times K$.

(i) For any $h \in H$ and $k \in K$, 
$$(h,1)(1,k) = (h,k) = (1,k)(h,1),$$ 
so they commute.

(ii) For any $(h,1) \in H \times \{1\}$ and $(a,b) \in H \times K$, 
$$(a,b)(h,1)(a,b)^{-1} = (aha^{-1},1) \in H \times \{1\},$$ 
showing normality. Similarly, $\{1\} \times K$ is normal.

(iii) The intersection consists of elements of both subgroups, so 
$$(H \times \{1\}) \cap (\{1\} \times K) = \{(1,1)\}.$$ 
Since every element of $H \times K$ can be written as $(h,k) = (h,1)(1,k)$, 
$$(H \times \{1\})(\{1\} \times K) = H \times K.$$

If $p$ is a prime, prove that $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2} \not\cong \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$.


In $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$, there exists an element of order $p^2$, namely $[1]$, since its order is the smallest $k$ such that $p^2 \mid k$.\\

In $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$, every element $(a, b)$ satisfies $(a, b)^p = (0, 0)$, meaning the order of every nonzero element divides $p$.\\

Since $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$ has an element of order $p^2$ while $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ does not, the two groups cannot be isomorphic.

Let $\mu: G \times G \to G$ be the operation on a group $G$; that is, $\mu(a, b) = ab$. If $G \times G$ is regarded as the direct product, prove that $\mu$ is a homomorphism if and only if $G$ is abelian.


Assume $G$ is not abelian, so there exist $a, b \in G$ such that $ab \neq ba$. Consider $\mu: G \times G \to G$ given by $\mu(a, b) = ab$. If $\mu$ were a homomorphism, then
$$\mu((a, b) (c, d)) = \mu(ac, bd) = (ac)(bd),$$
but homomorphism requires
$$\mu(a, b) \mu(c, d) = (ab)(cd).$$

Since $(ac)(bd) \neq (ab)(cd)$ in general when $G$ is non-abelian, $\mu$ is not a homomorphism.

Conversely, if $G$ is abelian, then $(ac)(bd) = (ab)(cd)$ for all $a, b, c, d \in G$, ensuring $\mu$ respects the product structure, proving it is a homomorphism.

Let $A$ be an abelian group, and let $\alpha: H \to A$ and $\beta: K \to A$ be homomorphisms.\\ Prove that there exists a unique homomorphism $\gamma: H \times K \to A$ with $\gamma(h, 1) = \alpha(h)$ for all $h \in H$ and $\gamma(1, k) = \beta(k)$ for all $k \in K$. Show that this may be false if $A$ is not abelian.

Define $\gamma: H \times K \to A$ by
$$\gamma(h, k) = \alpha(h) \beta(k).$$

Since $A$ is abelian, $\gamma$ is a homomorphism:

$$\gamma(h_1, k_1) \gamma(h_2, k_2) = (\alpha(h_1) \beta(k_1)) (\alpha(h_2) \beta(k_2)) = \alpha(h_1 h_2) \beta(k_1 k_2) = \gamma(h_1 h_2, k_1 k_2).$$

Thus, $\gamma$ exists.

For uniqueness, suppose $\gamma'$ is another such homomorphism. Then for all $(h, k) \in H \times K$, we have

$$\gamma(h, k) = \gamma(h, 1) \gamma(1, k) = \alpha(h) \beta(k) = \gamma'(h, k).$$

Thus, $\gamma = \gamma'$, proving uniqueness.

Take $A = S_3$
 Define homomorphisms $\alpha: \mathbb{Z} \to S_3$ and $\beta: \mathbb{Z} \to S_3$ by
$$\alpha(1) = (12), \quad \beta(1) = (13).$$Both are well-defined since $\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic.

If a homomorphism $\gamma: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to S_3$ existed satisfying $\gamma(h, 1) = \alpha(h)$ and $\gamma(1, k) = \beta(k)$, then for any $h, k$, we would require
$$\gamma(h, k) = \alpha(h) \beta(k) = (12)^h (13)^k.$$However, the order of multiplication matters in $S_3$, so the assignment $\gamma(h, k) = (12)^h (13)^k$ is not uniquely determined. Thus, uniqueness fails when $A$ is non-abelian.
