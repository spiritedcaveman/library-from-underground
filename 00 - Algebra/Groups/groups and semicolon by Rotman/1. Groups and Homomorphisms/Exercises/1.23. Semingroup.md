If $G$ is a group and $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \in G$, then
$$(a_1 * a_2 * \dots * a_n)^{-1} = a_n^{-1} * a_{n-1}^{-1} * \dots * a_1^{-1}.$$
Conclude that if $n \ge 0$, then $(a^{-1})^n = (a^n)^{-1}$.

 Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ be elements of an abelian semigroup. If $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ is a rearrangement of the $a_i$, then $a_1 * a_2 * \dots * a_n = b_1 * b_2 * \dots * b_n$.

 Let $a$ and $b$ lie in a semigroup $G$. If $a$ and $b$ commute, then $(a * b)^n = a^n * b^n$ for every $n \ge 1$; if $G$ is a group, then this equation holds for every $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

take $(ab)(ab)$ and dissolve the parenthesis, move all the b to one side and we are done

 A group in which $x^2 = e$ for every $x$ must be abelian.

$(xy)^2 = e \implies xyxy = e$.\\
using $x = x^{-1}$ and $y = y^{-1}$,
$xy = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1} x^{-1} = yx$.

 (i) Let $G$ be a finite abelian group containing no elements $a \ne e$ with $a^2 = e$. Evaluate $a_1 * a_2 * \dots * a_n$, where $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is a list with no repetitions, of all the elements of $G$.
 
 every element has its inverse that is different from it's own
so identity
$a_1 a_2 \dots a_n = e$

 (ii) Prove Wilson's theorem: If $p$ is prime, then
$$(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}.$$
 (Hint. The nonzero elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ form a multiplicative group.)
 
 Since $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ (the nonzero elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$) forms a group of order $p-1$, each element has a unique inverse modulo $p$. If $x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, then $x(x-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$, implying $x \equiv \pm 1$. So, every element in $\{1, 2, \dots, p-1\}$ except $1$ and $p-1$ pairs up with its distinct inverse.
Thus, their product simplifies as
$(p-1)! \equiv (-1) \pmod{p}$.
