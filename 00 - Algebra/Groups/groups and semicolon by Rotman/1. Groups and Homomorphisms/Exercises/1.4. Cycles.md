 If $1 \le r \le n$, then there are $(1/r) [n(n - 1) \dots (n - r + 1)]$ $r$-cycles in $S_n$.

 Choose $r$ elements from $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, which can be done in $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ ways.\\
 Next, arrange these $r$ elements in a cycle. Since a linear arrangement of $r$ elements has $r!$ orders, but all $r$ cyclic shifts represent the same cycle, we divide by $r$, yielding $(r-1)!$.\\
 Thus, the total number of $r$-cycles is $\binom{n}{r} \cdot (r-1)! = \frac{n(n-1) \dots (n-r+1)}{r}$.

 Prove the cancellation law for permutations: if either $\gamma \beta = \gamma \eta$ or $\beta \gamma = \eta \gamma$, then $\beta = \eta$.

Suppose $\sigma \tau = \sigma \gamma$
 Since permutations are bijective, $\sigma^{-1}$ exists and is unique. Left-multiplying by $\sigma^{-1}$, we get
$$\sigma^{-1} (\sigma \tau) = \sigma^{-1} (\sigma \gamma)$$ By associativity,
$$(\sigma^{-1} \sigma) \tau = (\sigma^{-1} \sigma) \gamma$$ Since $\sigma^{-1} \sigma = \operatorname{id}$, it simplifies to $\tau = \gamma$.
For the right-hand case the argument is quite the same...

 Let $\gamma = (i_1 \ i_2 \ \dots \ i_r)$ and $\beta = (j_1 \ j_2 \ \dots \ j_s)$. Prove that $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are disjoint if and only if $\{i_1, i_2, \dots, i_r\} \cap \{j_1, j_2, \dots, j_s\} = \emptyset$.

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $\rho$ and $\phi$ are not disjoint, i.e., they share an element $x$. Then $x$ is moved by both cycles, contradicting the definition of disjoint cycles. Thus, their supports must be disjoint:
$\{i_1, i_2, \dots, i_r\} \cap \{j_1, j_2, \dots, j_s\} = \emptyset$.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $\{i_1, \dots, i_r\} \cap \{j_1, \dots, j_s\} = \emptyset$. Then for all $x \in X = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, $\rho(x) \neq \phi(x)$ unless $x$ is fixed by at least one of them. This ensures $\rho$ and $\phi$ commute and act independently, proving they are disjoint.\\

proving **Two cycles $\rho = (i_1 i_2 \dots i_r)$ and $\phi = (j_1 j_2 \dots j_s)$ in $S_n$ are disjoint if they act on disjoint sets, meaning an element moved by one is fixed by the other.**

 If $\rho$ and $\phi$ are disjoint permutations, then $\rho \phi = \phi \rho$; that is, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ commute.

Let $\rho$ and $\phi$ be disjoint permutations. By definition, an element $x$ is moved by at most one of $\rho$ or $\phi$, while the other fixes $x$. Thus, for all $x$,
$(\rho \phi)(x) = \rho(\phi(x)) = \phi(\rho(x)) = (\phi \rho)(x)$.
Since $\rho \phi$ and $\phi \rho$ agree on all elements, they are equal, proving $\rho \phi = \phi \rho$.

# 1.9.
 If $\rho, \phi\in S_n$ are disjoint and $\rho \phi = 1$, then $\rho = 1 = \phi$.

Let $\rho, \phi \in S_n$ be disjoint and satisfy $\rho \phi = \operatorname{id}$. Since they are disjoint, each element is moved by at most one of them.

 Suppose for contradiction that at least one of $\rho$ or $\phi$ is nontrivial. Then there exists some $x$ moved by $\rho$, say $\rho(x) = y$. Since $\rho \phi = \operatorname{id}$, we have
$(\rho \phi)(x) = \rho(\phi(x)) = x$.

Since $\rho$ moves $x$, $\phi(x)$ must be $x$ (as $\phi$ is disjoint from $\rho$), contradicting the assumption that $\rho(x) \neq x$. The same argument applies to $\phi$. Hence, both $\rho$ and $\phi$ must be the identity.

inverting pair of cycles can't nontrivially disjoint.

 If $\gamma, \beta \in S_n$ are disjoint, prove that $(\gamma\beta)^k = \gamma^k \beta^k$ for all $k \ge 0$. Is this true if $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are not disjoint? (Define $\gamma^0 = 1$, $\gamma^1 = \gamma$, and, if $k \ge 2$, define $\gamma^k$ to be the composite of $\gamma$ with itself $k$ times.)
 
 
 If $\rho$ and $\phi$ are disjoint, they commute, i.e., $\rho \phi = \phi \rho$. Using induction on $k$, we show $(\rho \phi)^k = \rho^k \phi^k$. The base case $k = 0$ holds since both sides equal the identity. Assume it holds for $k$, i.e., $(\rho \phi)^k = \rho^k \phi^k$. Then
$(\rho \phi)^{k+1} = (\rho \phi)^k (\rho \phi) = (\rho^k \phi^k)(\rho \phi) = \rho^k (\phi^k \rho) \phi = \rho^k \rho \phi^k \phi = \rho^{k+1} \phi^{k+1}$,
proving the claim by induction.

If $\rho$ and $\phi$ are not disjoint, they may not commute, meaning $(\rho \phi)^k$ could differ from $\rho^k \phi^k$. For example, in $S_3$, taking $\rho = (1\ 2)$ and $\phi = (2\ 3)$, we find $(\rho \phi)^2 \neq \rho^2 \phi^2$, showing the claim fails in general.

 Show that a power of a cycle need not be a cycle.
 
 A power of a cycle need not be a cycle if it decomposes into multiple disjoint cycles. Consider $\sigma = (1\ 2\ 3\ 4) \in S_4$. Computing $\sigma^2$, we get
$\sigma^2 = (1\ 3)(2\ 4)$,
which is a product of two disjoint 2-cycles rather than a single 4-cycle.

**This happens whenever the order $k$ of the power divides the length $r$ of the cycle, leading to a decomposition into $\gcd(k, r)$ disjoint cycles of length $r / \gcd(k, r)$. Hence, a power of a cycle may fail to be a cycle.**

(i) Let $\sigma = (i_0 \ i_1 \ \dots \ i_{r-1})$ be an $r$-cycle. For every $j, k \ge 0$, prove that $\sigma^k(i_j) = i_{k+j}$ if subscripts are read modulo $r$.

Given $\sigma = (i_0\ i_1\ \dots\ i_{r-1})$, by definition, $\sigma(i_j) = i_{j+1}$ (indices modulo $r$). Applying $\sigma^k$, we get:
$$\sigma^k(i_j) = \sigma(\sigma^{k-1}(i_j))$$
By induction on $k$, assume $\sigma^{k-1}(i_j) = i_{(k-1)+j}$. Then,
$$\sigma^k(i_j) = \sigma(i_{(k-1)+j}) = i_{(k-1)+j+1} = i_{k+j} \mod r$$
So, $\sigma^k(i_j) = i_{k+j}$ modulo $r$

(ii) Prove that if $\rho$ is an $r$-cycle, then $\rho^r = 1$, but that $\rho^k \ne 1$ for every positive integer $k < r$.

Let $\rho = (i_0\ i_1\ \dots\ i_{r-1})$ be an $r$-cycle. Applying $\rho^r$, each element moves $r$ steps forward, returning to its original position:
$$\rho^r(i_j) = i_{j+r} = i_j \mod r$$
so, $\rho^r = \operatorname{id}$.

For $1 \leq k < r$, $\rho^k$ moves each element $k$ steps forward, meaning at least one element changes position. Since a nontrivial permutation cannot be the identity, $\rho^k \neq \operatorname{id}$ for $k < r$.

(iii) If $\gamma = \beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_m$ is a product of disjoint $r_i$-cycles $\beta_i$, then the smallest positive integer $l$ with $\gamma^l = 1$ is the least common multiple of $\{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_m\}$.

Let $\rho = \phi_1 \phi_2 \dots \phi_m$ be a product of disjoint $r_i$-cycles $\phi_i$. Since disjoint cycles commute, the order of $\rho$ is the least $\ell$ such that $\rho^\ell = 1$. Each $\phi_i$ has order $r_i$, meaning $\phi_i^{r_i} = 1$. Thus, $\rho^\ell = (\phi_1 \phi_2 \dots \phi_m)^\ell = \phi_1^\ell \phi_2^\ell \dots \phi_m^\ell$, which is the identity if and only if $\ell$ is a multiple of each $r_i$. The smallest such $\ell$ is precisely $\operatorname{lcm}(r_1, r_2, \dots, r_m)$, proving the claim.

 (i) A permutation $\gamma \in S_n$ is regular if either $\gamma$ has no fixed points and it is the product of disjoint cycles of the same length or $\gamma = 1$.
 
 Prove that $\gamma$ is regular **if and only if** $\gamma$ is a power of an $n$-cycle $\beta$; that is, $\gamma = \beta^m$ for some $m$. (Hint: if $\gamma = (a_1 \ a_2 \ \dots \ a_d)(b_1 \ b_2 \ \dots \ b_d) \dots (z_1 \ z_2 \ \dots \ z_d)$, where there are $m$ letters $a, b, \dots, z$, then let $\beta = (a_1 \ b_1 \ \dots \ z_1 \ a_2 \ b_2 \ \dots \ z_2 \ \dots \ a_k \ b_k \ \dots \ z_k)$.)

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $\rho$ is regular. Then $\rho$ has no fixed points and consists of disjoint cycles of the same length $d$. Let the elements of $S_n$ be partitioned into these cycles:
$$\rho = (a_1 a_2 \dots a_d)(b_1 b_2 \dots b_d) \dots (z_1 z_2 \dots z_d)$$
Define
$\phi = (a_1 b_1 \dots z_1\ a_2 b_2 \dots z_2\ \dots\ a_d b_d \dots z_d)$.
Since each cycle in $\rho$ is of length $d$, $\phi$ is an $n$-cycle where $n = md$, and $\rho$ is obtained by applying $\phi$ $m$ times, so $\rho = \phi^m$.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $\rho = \phi^m$ for some $n$-cycle $\phi$. Then $\rho$ is a product of disjoint cycles, each of length $d = n / \gcd(n, m)$. Since $\rho$ has no fixed points and consists of equal-length cycles, it is regular.


 (ii) If $\gamma$ is an $n$-cycle, then $\gamma^k$ is a product of $(n, k)$ disjoint cycles, each of length $n/(n, k)$. (Recall that $(n, k)$ denotes the gcd of $n$ and $k$.)

Let $\rho = (i_0\ i_1\ \dots\ i_{n-1})$ be an $n$-cycle. Then, by the formula
$$\rho^k(i_j) = i_{j+k} \mod n$$
$\rho^k$ partitions $\{i_0, i_1, \dots, i_{n-1}\}$ into cycles determined by the orbit of each element under $\rho^k$.

The jump in $\rho^k$ is $k$, so the smallest integer $t$ such that $(\rho^k)^t(i_j) = i_j$ satisfies \, $tk \equiv 0 \mod n$

The minimal such $t$ is $n / \gcd(n, k)$, implying each cycle in $\rho^k$ has length $n / \gcd(n, k)$. Since $n$ elements are divided evenly among these cycles, there are exactly $\gcd(n, k)$ disjoint cycles.

 (iii) If $p$ is a prime, then every power of a $p$-cycle is either a $p$-cycle or $1$.

Let $\rho$ be a $p$-cycle. By the previous result, $\rho^k$ is a product of $\gcd(p, k)$ disjoint cycles of length $p / \gcd(p, k)$.

 Since $p$ is prime, $\gcd(p, k)$ is either $1$ or $p$, giving either a single $p$-cycle or $1$

 (i) Let $\alpha = \beta \gamma$ in $S_n$, where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are disjoint. If $\beta$ moves $i$, then $\alpha^k(i) = \beta^k(i)$ for all $k \ge 0$.
 
 Since $\rho$ and $\gamma$ are disjoint, $\gamma(i) = i$ for any $i$ moved by $\rho$. By induction, $\gamma^k(i) = i$ for all $k \geq 0$. Since $\sigma = \rho \gamma$, we get
$$\sigma^k(i) = (\rho \gamma)^k(i) = \rho^k \gamma^k(i) = \rho^k(i)$$
since $\gamma^k(i) = i$.

 (ii) Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be cycles in $S_n$ (we do not assume that they have the same length). If there is $i_1$ moved by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and if $\alpha^k(i_1) = \beta^k(i_1)$ for all positive integers $k$, then $\alpha = \beta$.
 
 Suppose $\sigma \neq \tau$. Since both $\sigma$ and $\tau$ move $i_1$, their actions generate distinct orbits unless they are identical. However, the condition $\sigma^k(i_1) = \tau^k(i_1)$ for all $k > 0$ implies that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ move $i_1$ in exactly the same way. This forces $\sigma$ and $\tau$ to have the same cycle structure, contradicting $\sigma \neq \tau$.
