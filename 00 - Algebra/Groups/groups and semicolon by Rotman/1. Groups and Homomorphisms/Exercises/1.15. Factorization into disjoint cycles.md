  Let $\alpha$ be the permutation of $\{1, 2, \dots, 9\}$ defined by $\alpha(i) = 10 - i$. Write $\alpha$ as a product of disjoint cycles.

# 1.16.
 Let $p$ be a prime and let $\alpha \in S_n$. If $\alpha^p = 1$, then either $\alpha = 1$, $\alpha$ is a $p$-cycle, or $\alpha$ is a product of disjoint $p$-cycles. In particular, if $\alpha^2 = 1$, then either $\alpha = 1$, $\alpha$ is a transposition, or $\alpha$ is a product of disjoint transpositions.

 How many $\alpha \in S_n$ are there with $\alpha^2 = 1$? (Hint. $(i \ j) = (j \ i)$ and $(i \ j)(k \ l) = (k \ l)(i \ j)$.)

# 1.18.
 Give an example of permutations $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ in $S_5$ with $\alpha$ commuting with $\beta$, with $\beta$ commuting with $\gamma$, but with $\alpha$ not commuting with $\gamma$.
