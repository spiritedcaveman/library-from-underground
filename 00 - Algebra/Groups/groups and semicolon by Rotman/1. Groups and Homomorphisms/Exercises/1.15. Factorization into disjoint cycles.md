  Let $\alpha$ be the permutation of $\{1, 2, \dots, 9\}$ defined by $\alpha(i) = 10 - i$. Write $\alpha$ as a product of disjoint cycles.

\sigma = (1\ 9)(2\ 8)(3\ 7)(4\ 6)(5) = (1\ 9)(2\ 8)(3\ 7)(4\ 6)

 Let $p$ be a prime and let $\alpha \in S_n$. If $\alpha^p = 1$, then either $\alpha = 1$, $\alpha$ is a $p$-cycle, or $\alpha$ is a product of disjoint $p$-cycles. In particular, if $\alpha^2 = 1$, then either $\alpha = 1$, $\alpha$ is a transposition, or $\alpha$ is a product of disjoint transpositions.


Since $\sigma^p = 1$, every element in $S_n$ is mapped back to itself after exactly $p$ steps, implying that the order of each cycle in the disjoint cycle decomposition of $\sigma$ must divide $p$. Since $p$ is prime, the only possible orders are 1 (fixed points) or $p$ (full $p$-cycles). Thus, $\sigma$ is either the identity, a single $p$-cycle, or a product of disjoint $p$-cycles.

For $p = 2$, the only possibilities are the identity, a transposition (2-cycle), or a product of disjoint transpositions.

 How many $\alpha \in S_n$ are there with $\alpha^2 = 1$? (Hint. $(i \ j) = (j \ i)$ and $(i \ j)(k \ l) = (k \ l)(i \ j)$.)

 Give an example of permutations $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ in $S_5$ with $\alpha$ commuting with $\beta$, with $\beta$ commuting with $\gamma$, but with $\alpha$ not commuting with $\gamma$.
 
 $$\sigma = (1~2~3), \beta = (4~5)$ and $\gamma = (1~2)$$
