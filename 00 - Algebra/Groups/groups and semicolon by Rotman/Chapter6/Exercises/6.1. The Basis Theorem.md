# 6.1.
 Use the basis theorem to show that if $G$ is a finite abelian group of order $n$, and if $k|n$, then $G$ contains a subgroup of order $k$.
 


# 6.2.
Use the basis theorem to give a new proof of Theorem 2.19.



# 6.3.
 A finite abelian group $G$ is generated by its elements of largest order. Show, by considering $D_8$, that this may not be true of nonabelian groups.


# 6.4.
 If $G$ is a finite $p$-primary abelian group, and if $x \in G$ has largest order, then $\langle x \rangle$ is a direct summand of $G$.



# 6.5.
 If $G$ is an abelian group with invariant factors $(m_1, \dots, m_r)$, then the order of $G$ is $\prod_{i=1}^r m_i$ and the minimal exponent of $G$ is $m_r$.



# 6.6.
 If $G$ is a finite $p$-primary group, then $\Phi(G) = pG$. Conclude, from the Burnside basis theorem, that $d(G)$, the minimal number of generators of $G$, is $\dim G/pG$.



# 6.7.
 If $G$ and $H$ are elementary abelian $p$-groups, then $d(G \times H) = d(G) + d(H)$.



# 6.8.
Let $G$ be a direct sum of $b$ cyclic groups of order $p^m$. If $n < m$, then $p^n G / p^{n+1} G$ is elementary and $d(p^n G / p^{n+1} G) = b$.
