The prime decomposition of $18$ gives two obvious starting points: either a normal Sylow $3$-subgroup ($\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ or $\mathbb{Z}_9$), or a normal Sylow $2$-subgroup ($\mathbb{Z}_2$). 

**First class: vector space case}**

Let $V \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$, which can be viewed as a 2-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_3$. Then $\operatorname{Aut}(V) = \operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$, which has order $48$.

Consider homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ into $\operatorname{Aut}(V)$—i.e., involutive automorphisms of $V$. These define possible semidirect products $V \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$.

An automorphism of order $2$ has eigenvalues in $\mathbb{F}_3$ equal to $\pm1$. The vector space $V$ then decomposes into a direct sum of eigenspaces corresponding to the $+1$ and $-1$ eigenvalues.
There are three types of such involutions (up to conjugacy in $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$):

- Trivial automorphism (identity matrix): Both eigenvalues are $1$, the entire space is fixed. The semidirect product is trivial, so:
$$G = V \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2.$$
- Non-trivial actions
  
 **acting partially**
 This splits $V$ into a direct sum of a $1$-dimensional $+1$-eigenspace and a $1$-dimensional $-1$-eigenspace. The involution acts nontrivially only on half of $V$. This corresponds to a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(V)$ conjugate to:
 $$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}.$$
 The resulting group is isomorphic to:
 $$\mathbb{Z}_3 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3.$$
 
**acting fully**
 The involution acts as inversion on the entire space, i.e.    $$v \mapsto -v \quad \text{for all } v \in V.$$
 The corresponding matrix is:
$$\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}.$$
 The group becomes:
   $$(\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2 \quad \text{with } x \mapsto -x.$$






**Second class: cyclic or dihedral base**
Now let’s use $\mathbb{Z}_9$ as the normal Sylow $3$-subgroup. Since $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_9) \cong \mathbb{Z}_6$, there are two possible nontrivial actions of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $\mathbb{Z}_9$:


 Trivial action: Gives the direct product:
 $$\mathbb{Z}_9 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 = \mathbb{Z}_{18}.$$
Inversion action: The nontrivial automorphism of order $2$ maps $x \mapsto -x$. This gives the dihedral group:
 $$D_{18} = \mathbb{Z}_9 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2.$$



**Summary of all six groups of order $18$**:


$\circ$ $\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ — cyclic.
$\circ$ $D_{18}$ — dihedral.
$\circ$ $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ — abelian.
$\circ$ $S_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ — one eigenvalue flipped.
$\circ$ $(\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ with inversion on both 
$\circ$ The Heisenberg group over $\mathbb{F}_3$ — the nonabelian group of exponent 3 and order 27 (excluded here since not of order 18).
