 $A_5$ is a group of order 60 containing no subgroups of order 15 or 20 or of order 30.
 
 Let $|A_5| = 60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$. Suppose there is a subgroup of order 15. Then its index is 4, so $A_5$ acts by left multiplication on the cosets, giving a homomorphism $A_5 \to S_4$. Since $A_5$ is simple and the kernel is normal, the kernel is either trivial or all of $A_5$. It canâ€™t be all of $A_5$, so the homomorphism is injective. But then $A_5$ embeds in $S_4$, which is impossible since $|A_5| = 60 > 24 = |S_4|$. So no such subgroup exists.

Now suppose there is a subgroup of order 20. Then its index is 3, and the same argument gives an injection $A_5 \to S_3$, which contradicts $|A_5| = 60 > 6 = |S_3|$.

Suppose there is a subgroup of order 30. Then the index is 2, so the subgroup is normal. But $A_5$ is simple and has no proper nontrivial normal subgroups, so this is also impossible.

Thus $A_5$ has no subgroups of order 15, 20, or 30.

If $G$ is the subgroup of $GL(2, \mathbb{C})$ generated by
$$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}. $$
$G$ is $Q_{8}$ 

We compute powers:
$$A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} i^2 & 0 \\ 0 & i^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = -I.$$So $A^4 = (A^2)^2 = (-I)^2 = I$.$$B=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad B^2 = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = -I,$$
so $B^4 = (B^2)^2 = I$.
So $A^4 = B^4 = I$ and $A^2 = B^2 = -I$.
Now compute $BAB^{-1}$:
$$B^{-1} = -B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix},$$
$$BAB^{-1} = B A (-B) = -BAB.$$Compute $BA$:$$BA = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{pmatrix},$$then$$BAB^{-1} = - \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -i & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix}.$$Now compute $A^3$:$$A^3 = A \cdot A^2 = A \cdot (-I) = -A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$Which is equal to$$\begin{pmatrix} -i & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix} = BAB^{-1}.$$
So $BAB^{-1} = A^3$. Done.

The division ring $\mathbb{H}$ of **real quaternions** is a four-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ having a basis $\{1, i, j, k\}$ with multiplication satisfying

$$ ij = k, \quad jk = i, \quad ki = j, \quad ji = -k, \quad kj = -i, \quad ik = -j $$

 (i) Let $p$ be a prime. By Exercise 4.17, $P = UT(3, \mathbb{Z}_p)$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $GL(3, \mathbb{Z}_p)$. If $p$ is odd, prove that $P$ is a nonabelian group of order $p^3$ of exponent $p$. (Compare Exercise 1.26.) If $p=2$, show that $UT(3, \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong Q$.

 In Corollary 7.55, we shall prove that a group of squarefree order cannot be simple. Use this result to prove that if $|G| = p_1 \cdots p_r$, where $p_1 < p_2 < \cdots < p_r$ are primes, then $G$ contains a normal Sylow $p_r$-subgroup.
 
 

**Definition.** If $n \ge 3$, a **generalized quaternion group** (or dicyclic group) is a group $Q_n$ of order $2^n$ generated by elements $a$ and $b$ such that
$$ a^{2^{n-1}} = 1, \quad bab^{-1} = a^{-1}, \quad \text{and} \quad b^2 = a^{2^{n-2}}. $$


Let $G$ and $G'$ be two groups of order $2^n$, each generated by elements $a, b$ satisfying:
$$a^{2^{n-2}} = b^2$$
$$aba = b$$
(i.e., $ab = ba$ or $aba^{-1} = b$)
We aim to show $G \cong G'$.
From $aba = b$, multiplying both sides on the right by $a^{-1}$ gives $ab = ba$, so $a$ and $b$ commute. Hence $G$ is abelian.
But now consider the relation $a^{2^{n-2}} = b^2$. Since $a$ and $b$ commute, this relation determines all products in $G$.
Let $x = a$, $y = b$. Then $x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2$, and all elements can be written as $x^i y^j$, where $0 \le i < 2^{n-1}$ and $j = 0,1$. So the group has at most $2^n$ elements. Since $|G| = |G'| = 2^n$, the group is determined by the relations.
Now define a map $\phi : G \to G'$ by sending $a \mapsto a'$, $b \mapsto b'$, where $a', b'$ generate $G'$ and satisfy the same relations.
Then $\phi$ extends to a homomorphism since:
$$\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b) = a'b' = b'a' \text{ (since } a, b \text{ commute)}$$
$$\phi(a^{2^{n-2}}) = a'^{2^{n-2}} = b'^2 = \phi(b^2)$$
So $\phi$ preserves the defining relations and is surjective. Since $|G| = |G'|$, it is an isomorphism.
Hence any two such groups are isomorphic.
