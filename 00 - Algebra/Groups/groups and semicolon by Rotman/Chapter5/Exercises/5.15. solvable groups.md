## (4.36) Prove that there is no nonabelian simple group of order less than 60.

Let $|G| < 60$. From earlier, we know that the only simple groups of order less than 60 are cyclic of prime order (i.e., abelian simple), so any composition factor of $G$ is cyclic of prime order.

Thus, every composition factor of $G$ is abelian $\implies$ $G$ is solvable.

Burnside proved (using Representation Theory) that the number of elements in a conjugacy class of a finite simple group can never be a prime power larger than 1. Using this fact $\cdots$}\\

Assume $G$ is a finite group of order $p^m q^n$ and not solvable. Then $G$ has a composition series with a nonabelian simple factor, or is itself simple and nonabelian.
So we may assume $G$ is a nonabelian simple group.

Now
$$|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i} |C_i|$$
But since $G$ is simple nonabelian, $Z(G) = 1$, and all conjugacy classes have size $>1$. So:

$|G| = \sum \text{(conj class sizes)}$
All class sizes divide $|G| = p^m q^n$.\\
But no class size is a prime power $> 1$, by Burnside’s theorem (as given).
So all conjugacy class sizes are 1 (impossible) or not prime powers.

But all proper divisors of $p^m q^n$ are prime powers or products of two powers — so at least one class must have size a prime power $> 1$.
Contradiction.

Hence, $G$ cannot be nonabelian simple.
So all composition factors are abelian $\Rightarrow$ $G$ is solvable.

This proves Burnside’s theorem

Prove that the following two statements are equivalent:
(i) every group of odd order is solvable;
(ii) every finite simple group has even order.
(In 1963, Feit and Thompson proved (i); the original proof is 274 pages long.)

Assume for contradiction that there exists a finite simple group $G$ of odd order.

Then $G$ is nontrivial and simple $\Rightarrow$ not solvable (since simple $\nRightarrow$ solvable unless cyclic of prime order).
But this contradicts **every group of odd order is solvable**, which says every group of odd order is solvable.

$\therefore$ No such simple group exists. **So every finite simple group has even order.**


# 5.24.

Let $G$ be a finite group of order $> 1$. If $G$ is solvable, then $G$ contains a nontrivial normal abelian subgroup; if $G$ is not solvable, then $G$ contains a nontrivial normal subgroup $H$ with $H = H'$.


Since the derived series terminates at $1$ (as $G$ is solvable), the successive derived subgroups
$$G \triangleright G^{(1)} \triangleright G^{(2)} \triangleright \cdots \triangleright G^{(n)} = 1$$
are characteristic, hence normal in $G$.

Take the last nontrivial one, say $A = G^{(n-1)}$.

Then $A$ is normal in $G$, and $[A,A] = G^{(n)} = 1 \Rightarrow A$ is abelian and nontrivial.

For every group $G$, its center $Z(G)$ is characteristic in $G$.

For any $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$, since $\tau$ is a homomorphism and injective, it suffices to show $\tau(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G)$ to conclude $Z(G)$ is characteristic.

 Let $z \in Z(G)$, so $zx = xz$ for all $x \in G$. Applying $\tau$ gives $\tau(z)\tau(x) = \tau(zx) = \tau(xz) = \tau(x)\tau(z)$, so $\tau(z)$ commutes with every element of the form $\tau(x)$, i.e., with all of $G$ since $\tau$ is surjective onto $G$. Thus $\tau(z) \in Z(G)$, and so $\tau(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G)$, as required.

If $H \triangleleft G$ and $(|H|, [G: H]) = 1$, then $H \text{ char } G$.


Use the fact that any $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ maps normal subgroups to normal subgroups of the same order.

Since $H \triangleleft G$ and $|H|$ is coprime to $[G : H]$, $H$ is the unique subgroup of order $|H|$ that's normal.

So for any $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$, $\tau(H)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order $|H| \Rightarrow \tau(H) = H$.

$H$ is characteristic in $G$.

# 5.27.
If $H \text{ char } G$ and $H \le K \le G$, then $K/H \text{ char } G/H$ implies $K \text{ char } G$.

Let $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$. Since $H \text{ char } G$, we have $\tau(H) = H$, so $\tau$ induces an automorphism $\bar{\tau} \in \operatorname{Aut}(G/H)$.

Given that $K/H \text{ char } G/H$, we have $\bar{\tau}(K/H) = K/H$, i.e., $\tau(K)H = K$.

But $\tau(K) \subseteq G$ and $H \le \tau(K) \Rightarrow \tau(K) \subseteq K$.

Now apply the same to $\tau^{-1}$ to get $\tau^{-1}(K)$ and by injectivity we are done

# 5.28.

Give an example of a group $G$ containing a normal subgroup that is not a characteristic subgroup. (Hint. Let $G$ be abelian.)

  just try constructing a group that has two copies of the same subgroup 
  
  1. ### longboard kayak_:_ 
    
    i think taking multiple groups of same order and then taking semidirect product of it is the key to generally construct this? (edited)
    
2. ### _[_12:52_]_HChan_:_ 
    
    no, you can probably get much more general than that
    

so $V_{4}$ also any semidirect production of $C_{n}$ with itself

$Q_{8}$ works, all the groups are normal 3 cyclic order4 groups which upon aut interacts, see the how i,j,k plays in bw them so them wont be invariant
