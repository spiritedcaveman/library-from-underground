## A finite group G with no characteristic subgroups other than G and 1 is either simple or a direct product of isomorphic simple groups.

## Every refinement of a solvable series is a solvable series.

Since $[G,G] \subseteq N$, if $N \subseteq N'$, then $[G,G] \subseteq N'$ too.  
Thus, $G/N'$ is abelian whenever $G/N$ is.  

So when refining a solvable series, the new factors are still abelian.  

Let $H$ be a subgroup of the group $G$ with the property that whenever two elements of $G$ are conjugate, then the conjugating element can be chosen within $H$. Prove that the commutator subgroup $G'$ of $G$ is contained in $H$.



# 5.16.
## A solvable group having a composition series must be finite.

Since each composition factor $K_i/K_{i+1}$ is simple and solvable, it must be cyclic of prime order.  
Thus, $G$ is built from finitely many prime order groups, and its order is the product of their orders — a finite product of primes.\\

Therefore, $G$ must be finite.

# 5.17.
If $G$ has a composition series and if $H \triangleleft G$, then $G$ has a composition series one of whose terms is $H$.


Let $G$ have a composition series. Then $G$ is of finite length, so both $H \triangleleft G$ and $G/H$ are of finite length (subgroup and quotient of a finite-length group). Therefore, both $H$ and $G/H$ have composition series.\\

Now consider a composition series of $H$:

$\{e\} = H_0 \triangleleft H_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft H_r = H$
and a composition series of $G/H$:
$\{e\} = K_0 \triangleleft K_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft K_s = G/H$

Lift this to a normal series in $G$ via the correspondence theorem:
$H = \pi^{-1}(K_0) \triangleleft \pi^{-1}(K_1) \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft \pi^{-1}(K_s) = G$

Concatenating the two gives:
$\{e\} \triangleleft H_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft H_r = H \triangleleft \pi^{-1}(K_1) \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft G$
Each factor is simple (being a factor of a composition series)
so...

(i) If $S$ and $T$ are solvable subgroups of $G$ with $S \triangleleft G$, then $ST$ is solvable.

Since $S \triangleleft G$, we have $S \triangleleft ST$ and $ST/S \cong T/(S \cap T)$.\\

. $S$ is solvable (given),\\
. $T$ is solvable $\Rightarrow T/(S \cap T)$ solvable,\\
. So $ST/S$ is solvable.\\

Then by the extension property of solvable groups:
$$
S \text{ solvable},\quad ST/S \text{ solvable} \Rightarrow ST \text{ is solvable}.
$$

(ii) Every finite group $G$ has a unique maximal normal solvable subgroup $\mathfrak{S}(G)$; moreover, $G/\mathfrak{S}(G)$ has no nontrivial normal solvable subgroups.

Let $\mathcal{S} = \{N \triangleleft G \mid N \text{ solvable} \}$.\\

~ Since $G$ is finite, $\mathcal{S}$ has maximal elements under inclusion.
~ The join (product) of any two normal solvable subgroups is again normal and solvable.
~ So the union of all in $\mathcal{S}$ generates a unique maximal normal solvable subgroup: define $\mathfrak{S}(G)$ as that.

Now take $G/\mathfrak{S}(G)$. Any normal solvable subgroup lifts to a normal solvable subgroup in $G$ containing $\mathfrak{S}(G)$—contradicting maximality unless it’s trivial.

If $M$ and $N$ are normal soluble subgroups of a group $G$, then $MN$ is again a soluble normal subgroup. For $MN/N \cong M/(M \cap N)$, and $M/(M \cap N)$ is soluble as a quotient of the soluble $M$, so $MN/N$ is soluble. Since $N$ is soluble, $MN$ must be soluble. This shows that in every group there is a unique maximal soluble normal subgroup (it could be trivial). Let's call this group $\mathfrak{S}(G)$.\\

Now assume $K/\mathfrak{S}(G)$ is a non-trivial abelian normal subgroup of $G/\mathfrak{S}(G)$. Then $\mathfrak{S}(G) \triangleleft K \triangleleft G$, with the commutator subgroup $K' \subseteq \mathfrak{S}(G)$. Since $\mathfrak{S}(G)$ is soluble, $K'$ is soluble and hence $K$ must be soluble. By the soluble normal maximality of $\mathfrak{S}(G)$, $K \subseteq \mathfrak{S}(G)$, which is a contradiction.

# 5.19.
(i) If $p$ and $q$ are primes, then every group of order $p^2q$ is solvable


Then $|G| = p^3$, a $p$-group. Every finite $p$-group is nilpotent, hence solvable.

 (p<q)Then $n_q \equiv 1 \mod q$ and $n_q \mid p^2$. But $p < q$ implies $n_q = 1$, so the Sylow $q$-subgroup is normal. The quotient has order $p^2$, hence abelian. So $G$ is solvable.

(p>q) Same argument: $n_p \equiv 1 \mod p$, $n_p \mid q$. Since $q < p$, $n_p = 1$, so the Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal. Quotient has order $q$, hence cyclic. So $G$ is solvable.

(ii) If $p$ and $q$ are primes with $p < q$, then every group of order $pq^n$ is solvable. $(Hint. Use \, Sylow's \,theorems.)$

Let $|G| = pq^n$ with primes $p < q$. By Sylow’s theorems, $n_q \equiv 1 \mod q$ and $n_q \mid p$.

Since $p < q$, the only possibility is $n_q = 1$, so the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ is unique and normal in $G$.

Then $G/Q$ has order $p$, so is cyclic, hence solvable. $Q$ has order $q^n$, a prime power, so it has a composition series (as all $q$-groups do), hence solvable.

Thus $G$ is an extension of solvable groups, hence solvable.

5.20. (i) Show that $S_4$ has no series
$$S_4 = G_0 \triangleright G_1 \triangleright \cdots \triangleright G_n = 1$$
such that all factor groups are cyclic and each $G_i$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
(A group $G$ with such a series is called supersolvable, and we now see that not every solvable group is supersolvable.)

$S_4 \triangleright A_4 \triangleright V_4 \triangleright 1$

$S_4 \triangleright D_8 \triangleright 1$, where $D_8 = \langle (12), (34), (13)(24) \rangle$

Refine the first using the second:
$A_4 \cap D_8 = V_4$
$V_4 \cap D_8 = \langle(12)(34)\rangle$


$S_4 \triangleright A_4 \triangleright V_4 \triangleright \langle(12)(34)\rangle \triangleright 1$}

Refine the second using the first:
$D_8 \cap A_4 = V_4$
$D_8 \cap V_4 = \langle(12)(34)\rangle$


$S_4 \triangleright D_8 \triangleright V_4 \triangleright \langle(12)(34)\rangle \triangleright 1$

(ii) Show that every finite $p$-group is supersolvable.

Take $Z(G) \triangleleft G$, with $Z(G) \ne 1$. Induct on $|G|$:

$Z(G)$ is abelian $p$-group $\implies$ has normal series with cyclic factors.
$G/Z(G)$ is a $p$-group of smaller order $\implies$ by induction is supersolvable.
Lift the series and prepend $Z(G)$'s series.

So $G$ is supersolvable.


Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group. Then $Z(G) \ne 1$, so there exists an element $x \in Z(G)$ of order $p$ (since any finite abelian $p$-group has an element of order $p$). Let $H = \langle x \rangle \triangleleft G$.

Then $H \cong C_p$, and $G/H$ is again a finite $p$-group of smaller order. By induction, $G/H$ is supersolvable.

Lift a normal series with cyclic factors from $G/H$ to $G$, and prepend $H \triangleleft G$.

Therefore, $G$ has a normal series with cyclic factors: $G$ is supersolvable.

# 5.21.
If $G$ is a group with $|G| < 60$, then $G$ is solvable. (Hint. Use Exercise 4.36.)

## (4.36) Prove that there is no nonabelian simple group of order less than 60.

Let $|G| < 60$. From earlier, we know that the only simple groups of order less than 60 are cyclic of prime order (i.e., abelian simple), so any composition factor of $G$ is cyclic of prime order.

Thus, every composition factor of $G$ is abelian $\implies$ $G$ is solvable.

# 5.22.
Burnside proved (using Representation Theory) that the number of elements in a conjugacy class of a finite simple group can never be a prime power larger than 1. Using this fact $\cdots$}\\

Assume $G$ is a finite group of order $p^m q^n$ and not solvable. Then $G$ has a composition series with a nonabelian simple factor, or is itself simple and nonabelian.
So we may assume $G$ is a nonabelian simple group.

Now
$$|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i} |C_i|$$
But since $G$ is simple nonabelian, $Z(G) = 1$, and all conjugacy classes have size $>1$. So:

$|G| = \sum \text{(conj class sizes)}$
All class sizes divide $|G| = p^m q^n$.\\
But no class size is a prime power $> 1$, by Burnside’s theorem (as given).
So all conjugacy class sizes are 1 (impossible) or not prime powers.

But all proper divisors of $p^m q^n$ are prime powers or products of two powers — so at least one class must have size a prime power $> 1$.
Contradiction.

Hence, $G$ cannot be nonabelian simple.
So all composition factors are abelian $\Rightarrow$ $G$ is solvable.

This proves Burnside’s theorem

# 5.23.
Prove that the following two statements are equivalent:
(i) every group of odd order is solvable;
(ii) every finite simple group has even order.
(In 1963, Feit and Thompson proved (i); the original proof is 274 pages long.)

Assume for contradiction that there exists a finite simple group $G$ of odd order.

Then $G$ is nontrivial and simple $\Rightarrow$ not solvable (since simple $\nRightarrow$ solvable unless cyclic of prime order).
But this contradicts **every group of odd order is solvable**, which says every group of odd order is solvable.

$\therefore$ No such simple group exists. **So every finite simple group has even order.**


# 5.24.

Let $G$ be a finite group of order $> 1$. If $G$ is solvable, then $G$ contains a nontrivial normal abelian subgroup; if $G$ is not solvable, then $G$ contains a nontrivial normal subgroup $H$ with $H = H'$.


Since the derived series terminates at $1$ (as $G$ is solvable), the successive derived subgroups
$$G \triangleright G^{(1)} \triangleright G^{(2)} \triangleright \cdots \triangleright G^{(n)} = 1$$
are characteristic, hence normal in $G$.

Take the last nontrivial one, say $A = G^{(n-1)}$.

Then $A$ is normal in $G$, and $[A,A] = G^{(n)} = 1 \Rightarrow A$ is abelian and nontrivial.

# 5.25.
For every group $G$, its center $Z(G)$ is characteristic in $G$.

For any $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$, since $\tau$ is a homomorphism and injective, it suffices to show $\tau(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G)$ to conclude $Z(G)$ is characteristic.

 Let $z \in Z(G)$, so $zx = xz$ for all $x \in G$. Applying $\tau$ gives $\tau(z)\tau(x) = \tau(zx) = \tau(xz) = \tau(x)\tau(z)$, so $\tau(z)$ commutes with every element of the form $\tau(x)$, i.e., with all of $G$ since $\tau$ is surjective onto $G$. Thus $\tau(z) \in Z(G)$, and so $\tau(Z(G)) \subseteq Z(G)$, as required.

# 5.26.
If $H \triangleleft G$ and $(|H|, [G: H]) = 1$, then $H \text{ char } G$.


Use the fact that any $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ maps normal subgroups to normal subgroups of the same order.

Since $H \triangleleft G$ and $|H|$ is coprime to $[G : H]$, $H$ is the unique subgroup of order $|H|$ that's normal.

So for any $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$, $\tau(H)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order $|H| \Rightarrow \tau(H) = H$.

$H$ is characteristic in $G$.

---

# 5.27.
If $H \text{ char } G$ and $H \le K \le G$, then $K/H \text{ char } G/H$ implies $K \text{ char } G$.

Let $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$. Since $H \text{ char } G$, we have $\tau(H) = H$, so $\tau$ induces an automorphism $\bar{\tau} \in \operatorname{Aut}(G/H)$.

Given that $K/H \text{ char } G/H$, we have $\bar{\tau}(K/H) = K/H$, i.e., $\tau(K)H = K$.

But $\tau(K) \subseteq G$ and $H \le \tau(K) \Rightarrow \tau(K) \subseteq K$.

Now apply the same to $\tau^{-1}$ to get $\tau^{-1}(K)$ and by injectivity we are done

Give an example of a group $G$ containing a normal subgroup that is not a characteristic subgroup. (Hint. Let $G$ be abelian.)

  just try constructing a group that has two copies of the same subgroup 
  
  1. ### longboard kayak_:_ 
    
    i think taking multiple groups of same order and then taking semidirect product of it is the key to generally construct this? (edited)
    
2. ### _[_12:52_]_HChan_:_ 
    
    no, you can probably get much more general than that
    

so $V_{4}$ also any semidirect production of $C_{n}$ with itself

$Q_{8}$ works, all the groups are normal 3 cyclic order4 groups which upon aut interacts, see the how i,j,k plays in bw them so them wont be invariant

# 5.29.
Prove that the higher commutator subgroups are fully invariant.



$$G^{(0)} = G, \quad G^{(1)} = G' = [G, G], \quad \text{and} \quad G^{(n+1)} = [G^{(n)}, G^{(n)}]$$

Base case ($n = 0$): Trivially, $\varphi(G) \subseteq G$.

Inductive step: Assume $\varphi(G^{(n)}) \subseteq G^{(n)}$ for all $\varphi: G \to G$.

Then $\varphi([x, y]) = [\varphi(x), \varphi(y)]$ for all $x, y \in G^{(n)}$, and since $\varphi(x), \varphi(y) \in G^{(n)}$ by the inductive hypothesis, it follows that $\varphi([x, y]) \in [G^{(n)}, G^{(n)}] = G^{(n+1)}$.
Thus, $\varphi(G^{(n+1)}) \subseteq G^{(n+1)}$, completing the induction.

# 5.30.
Show that $Z(G)$ may not be fully invariant. $(Hint:$ Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times S_3.)$ (See Exercise 5.25.)

define
$$
\varphi(a, b) = (1, b) \quad \text{(killing the } \mathbb{Z}_2 \text{ part)}

This is a group homomorphism. But:
$$
\varphi(Z(G)) = \varphi(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \{1\}) = \{1\} \times \{1\} = 1 \not\supseteq Z(G)
$$
