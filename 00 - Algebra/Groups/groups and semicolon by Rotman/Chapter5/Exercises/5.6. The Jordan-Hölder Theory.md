# 5.6.
A normal series is a composition series if and only if it has maximal length; that is, every refinement of it has the same length.
 
# 5.7.
A normal series is a composition series if and only if its factor groups are either simple or trivial.

# 5.8.
 Every finite group has a composition series.
 
# 5.9.
(i) An abelian group has a composition series if and only if it is finite.
(ii) Give an example of an infinite group which has a composition series.

# 5.10.
 If $G$ is a finite group having a normal series with factor groups $H_0, H_1, \dots, H_n$, then $|G| = \prod_{i=0}^n |H_i|$.
 

# 5.11.
 Let $G$ and $H$ be finite groups. If there are normal series of $G$ and of $H$ having the same set of factor groups, then $G$ and $H$ have the same composition factors.
 
# 5.12.
 (i) Exhibit a composition series for $S_4$.
(ii) Show that $S_n$ is solvable for $n \le 4$.

# 5.13
Assume that $G = H_1 \times \cdots \times H_m = K_1 \times \cdots \times K_n$, where each $H_i$ and $K_j$ is simple. Prove that $m = n$ and there is a permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ with $K_{\pi(i)} \cong H_i$ for all $i$. (Hint. Construct composition series for $G$.)

# 5.14.
Prove that the dihedral groups $D_{2n}$ are solvable.
