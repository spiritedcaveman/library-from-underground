symmetric matrix is a Hermitian matrix with specialty of having a equal conjugate. And all Hermitian matrix can find an unitary matrix to diagonalize no matter its eigenvalues are distinct or not.

and the change of bases matrices are orthogonal

If $A$ and $B$ are $n×n$ real symmetric matrices that commute, then they can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix: there exists a basis of $\Bbb{R}^n$ such that every element of the basis is an for both $A$ and $B$.

In fact, the eigenvalues are the entries in the diagonal matrix $D$, and therefore $D$ is uniquely determined by $A$ upto the order of entries.


The eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are ==always real numbers==. Furthermore, eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal.
