Let $T$ be a linear operator on $F^2$. Prove that any non-zero vector which is not a characteristic vector for $T$ is a cyclic vector for $T$. Hence, prove that either $T$ has a cyclic vector or $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.

Let $v \in F^2$ be nonzero and not an eigenvector of $T$. Then ${v, Tv}$ is linearly independent (else $Tv = \lambda v$, contradiction). So ${v, Tv}$ spans $F^2$ and $v$ is cyclic.

Hence, either $T$ has a cyclic vector, or every nonzero vector is an eigenvector. In that case, $T$ is diagonalizable with the same eigenvalue $\lambda$ for all $v \ne 0$, so $T = \lambda I$.

Let $T$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix
$$\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.$$
Prove that $T$ has no cyclic vector. What is the $T$-cyclic subspace generated by the vector $(1, -1, 3)$?



The minimal polynomial of $T$ is $(x - 2)(x + 1)$, and the characteristic polynomial is $(x - 2)^2(x + 1)$. So $T$ is diagonalizable with two distinct eigenspaces:

Eigenspace for $2$: dimension 2
Eigenspace for $-1$: dimension 1
Hence, no single vector can generate $\mathbb{R}^3$ under $T$, so $T$ has no cyclic vector.
Now consider $v = (1, -1, 3)$. Compute:

$Tv = (2, -2, -3)$
$T^2v = (4, -4, 3)$
Then, the span of $\{v, Tv, T^2v\}$ lies in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Check linear independence:
Let $a v + b Tv + c T^2v = 0$:
$$a(1, -1, 3) + b(2, -2, -3) + c(4, -4, 3) = 0$$Compute the linear combination:
$$(1a + 2b + 4c, -1a - 2b - 4c, 3a - 3b + 3c) = 0$$Equate components:

$a + 2b + 4c = 0$
$-a - 2b - 4c = 0$
$3a - 3b + 3c = 0$
From (1) and (2): Adding gives $0 = 0$

So (1) = (2) implies nothing new. Use (1): $a = -2b - 4c$

Plug into (3):
$$3(-2b - 4c) - 3b + 3c = -6b - 12c - 3b + 3c = -9b - 9c = 0 \Rightarrow b + c = 0$$Then $a = -2b - 4(-b) = -2b + 4b = 2b$
So all three vectors are linearly dependent. Hence, $\{v, Tv, T^2v\}$ spans a 2D space.
Therefore, the $T$-cyclic subspace generated by $v$ is:
$$Z(v; T) = \operatorname{span} \{v, Tv\} = \operatorname{span} \{(1, -1, 3),\ (2, -2, -3)\}$$
which is 2-dimensional.

Let $T$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{C}^3$ which is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -i \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$
Find the $T$-annihilator of the vector $(1, 0, 0)$. Find the $T$-annihilator of $(1, 0, i)$.
Let $v = (1, 0, 0)$ and $w = (1, 0, i)$. Denote $T$ by the matrix:
$$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -i \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
For $v = (1, 0, 0)$:
Compute:
$T(v) = A \cdot (1, 0, 0)^T = (1, -1, 0)^T$
$T^2(v) = A \cdot (1, -1, 0)^T = (0, -3, -1)^T$
$T^3(v) = A \cdot (0, -3, -1)^T = (-3, -8, -3)^T$
Now try to find scalars $a,b,c$ such that
$$T^3v + aT^2v + bTv + c v = 0$$So:$$(-3, -8, -3) + a(0, -3, -1) + b(1, -1, 0) + c(1, 0, 0) = 0$$
Sum:
1st: $-3 + b + c = 0$
2nd: $-8 - 3a - b = 0$
3rd: $-3 - a = 0$
From 3rd: $a = -3$
Then 2nd: $-8 + 9 - b = 0 \Rightarrow b = 1$
Then 1st: $-3 + 1 + c = 0 \Rightarrow c = 2$
So annihilator is:
$T^3 - 3T^2 + T + 2$

For $w = (1, 0, i)$:
Compute:
$T(w) = A \cdot (1, 0, i)^T = (1, -1 - i^2, i) = (1, -1 + 1, i) = (1, 0, i)$
So $T(w) = w$, i.e., $w$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$.
So:
$(T-I)(w)=0 \Rightarrow \text{Annihilator: } T-1$

Prove that if $T^2$ has a cyclic vector, then $T$ has a cyclic vector. Is the converse true?

Vector $x$ is cyclic for $T$ if vectors $T^nx$ span whole space. Clearly, vectors of the form $T^{2n}x$ are a subset of these.

might not be if the containment is proper.

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over the field $F$, and let $N$ be a nilpotent linear operator on $V$. Suppose $N^{n-1} \ne 0$, and let $\alpha$ be any vector in $V$ such that $N^{n-1}\alpha \ne 0$. Prove that $\alpha$ is a cyclic vector for $N$. What exactly is the matrix of $N$ in the ordered basis $\{\alpha, N\alpha, \dots, N^{n-1}\alpha\}$?


Since $N$ is nilpotent with $N^n = 0$ and $N^{n-1} \alpha \ne 0$, the vectors $\alpha, N\alpha, \dots, N^{n-1}\alpha$ are linearly independent. Thus, they form a basis of $V$.
So $\alpha$ is a cyclic vector for $N$, because $Z(\alpha; N) = \text{span}\{\alpha, N\alpha, \dots, N^{n-1}\alpha \} = V$.
Now in the basis $\{\alpha, N\alpha, \dots, N^{n-1}\alpha \}$, $N$ acts as:

$N(\alpha) = N\alpha = \text{2nd basis vector}$
$N(N\alpha) = N^2\alpha = \text{3rd basis vector}$
$\dots$
$N(N^{n-2}\alpha) = N^{n-1}\alpha = \text{last basis vector}$
$N(N^{n-1}\alpha) = N^n\alpha = 0$
So, the matrix of $N$ in this basis is the Jordan block of size $n$ for eigenvalue $0$:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Give a direct proof that if $A$ is the companion matrix of the monic polynomial $p$, then $p$ is the characteristic polynomial for $A$.

Let $f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ be a monic polynomial over a field $\mathbb{F}$. The companion matrix of $f$ is:
$$C(f) = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -a_0 \\
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -a_1 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & -a_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & -a_{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}$$Now define $G = \mathbb{F}[x]/(f(x))$. This is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}$ with basis:$$\{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^{n-1}\}$$
Define the linear operator $T : G \to G$ by $T(g(x)) = x \cdot g(x)$ (i.e., left multiplication by $x$ modulo $f(x)$).
Then, with respect to this basis, the matrix of $T$ is exactly $C(f)$. This is because:

$T(1) = x$
$T(x) = x^2$
$\dots$
$T(x^{n-2}) = x^{n-1}$
$T(x^{n-1}) = x^n \equiv -a_{n-1}x^{n-1} - \dots - a_0 \pmod f$
So, the action of $T$ is fully encoded by $C(f)$. Since $f(x) = 0$ in $G$, it follows that:
$$f(T) = 0 \Rightarrow f(C(f)) = 0$$
Now:

$f(C(f)) = 0$ means $f$ annihilates $C(f)$
But $f$ has degree $n$, and $C(f)$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, so $f$ is the minimal polynomial
Minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and both have degree $n$, so they must be equal
Thus, $f(x)$ is the characteristic polynomial of its companion matrix $C(f)$.

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space, and let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. Suppose that $T$ is diagonalizable.
(a) If $T$ has a cyclic vector, show that $T$ has $n$ distinct characteristic values.


If $T$ has a cyclic vector $\alpha$, then $\{ \alpha, T\alpha, \dots, T^{n-1}\alpha \}$ is a basis of $V$. So the minimal polynomial of $T$ has degree $n$. Since $T$ is diagonalizable, the minimal polynomial is the product of distinct linear factors. So $T$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues.

(b) If $T$ has $n$ distinct characteristic values, and if $\{\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\}$ is a basis of characteristic vectors for $T$, show that $\alpha = \alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_n$ is a cyclic vector for $T$.

Suppose $T$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$ with eigenvectors $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ forming a basis. Let $\alpha = \alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_n$.
Then:
$$T^k(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^k \alpha_i$$So the set $\{ T^k(\alpha) \}_{k=0}^{n-1}$ spans the same space as $\{ \alpha_i \}$ if the $n \times n$ matrix$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\lambda_1 & \lambda_2 & \cdots & \lambda_n \\
\lambda_1^2 & \lambda_2^2 & \cdots & \lambda_n^2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\lambda_1^{n-1} & \lambda_2^{n-1} & \cdots & \lambda_n^{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}$$
is invertible — which it is, since it’s a Vandermonde matrix and $\lambda_i$ are distinct.
Therefore, $\{ T^k(\alpha) \}_{k=0}^{n-1}$ spans $V$, so $\alpha$ is a cyclic vector.
