$T-I$ has c.p. of rank $r$ nulity $n-r$ and the eigenspace has dimension $n-r$ 



in R3 we have to have a characteristic value of any linear map well this can rgued from the fuindamental theorem of algrbra applyoing on the characteristic polynomial



minimal poly factors in linear forms iff T is diagonalisable
