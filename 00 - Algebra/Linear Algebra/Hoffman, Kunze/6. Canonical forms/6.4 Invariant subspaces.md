Let $T$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the matrix of which in the standard ordered basis is
 $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}.$$
(a) Prove that the only subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^2$ invariant under $T$ are $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the zero subspace.

Let $T$ be represented by $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 2 & -2 \end{bmatrix}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$. The characteristic polynomial is
$\chi_T(x) = \det(xI - A) = \begin{vmatrix} x-1 & 1 \\ -2 & x+2 \end{vmatrix} = (x - 1)(x + 2) + 2 = x^2 + x.$

So the eigenvalues are $0$ and $-1$, but we must check their geometric multiplicities. Compute:
$A - 0I = A \Rightarrow \operatorname{N}(A) = \{(x,y): x - y = 0, 2x - 2y = 0\} \Rightarrow \dim \ker A = 1,$
$A + I = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \operatorname{N}(A + I) = \{(x,y): 2x - y = 0\} \Rightarrow \dim \ker(A + I) = 1.$
So $T$ has two distinct eigenvalues, each with 1-dimensional eigenspaces. They span whole of $\Bbb{R}^{2}$


(b) If $U$ is the linear operator on $\mathbb{C}^2$, the matrix of which in the standard ordered basis is $A$, show that $U$ has 1-dimensional invariant subspaces.

Over $\mathbb{C}$, the same matrix $A$ defines $U$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The minimal polynomial $x(x+1)$ splits in $\mathbb{C}$, and the eigenspaces for $0$ and $-1$ are 1-dimensional as before. Hence, the corresponding eigenspaces
$E_0 = \operatorname{N}(A), \quad E_{-1} = \operatorname{N}(A + I)$
are complex 1-dimensional subspaces invariant under $U$. So $U$ has nontrivial invariant subspaces of dimension 1.

Let $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$.


(a) The characteristic polynomial is

$\chi_T(x) = \det(xI - A) = \begin{vmatrix} x-1 & 1 \\ -2 & x-2 \end{vmatrix} = (x-1)(x-2) + 2 = x^2 - 3x + 4$.

This has no real roots (discriminant $< 0$), so $T$ has no real eigenvectors. Hence, no nontrivial $T$-invariant subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ other than $\{0\}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$.


(b) Over $\mathbb{C}$, the characteristic polynomial splits: $x^2 - 3x + 4 = (x - \tfrac{3}{2} + \tfrac{\sqrt{7}}{2}i)(x - \tfrac{3}{2} - \tfrac{\sqrt{7}}{2}i)$. So $U$ has two distinct complex eigenvalues and corresponding 1-dimensional eigenspaces, which are $U$-invariant.

Let $W$ be an invariant subspace for $T$. Prove that the minimal polynomial for the restriction operator $T_W$ divides the minimal polynomial for $T$, without referring to matrices.

Let $T: V \to V$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and let $W \subseteq V$ be a $T$-invariant subspace. Define $T_W: W \to W$ by $T_W(w) = T(w)$ for $w \in W$. Let $m_T(x)$ and $m_{T_W}(x)$ be the minimal polynomials of $T$ and $T_W$, respectively.

Since $W$ is $T$-invariant, for all $w \in W$ and all $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}[x]$, we have $f(T)(w) = f(T_W)(w)$. In particular, $m_T(T)(w) = 0$ for all $w \in W$, so $m_T(T_W) = 0$ as an operator on $W$.

Hence, $m_T(x)$ is an annihilating polynomial for $T_W$. By definition, $m_{T_W}(x)$ is the monic polynomial of least degree such that $m_{T_W}(T_W) = 0$. Therefore, $m_{T_W}(x)$ divides $m_T(x)$ in $\mathbb{F}[x]$.

Let $c$ be a characteristic value of $T$ and let $W$ be the space of characteristic vectors associated with the characteristic value $c$. What is the restriction operator $T_W$?

1. Let
    $A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & -2 & 2 \\ 2 & -3 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.$
    Is $A$ similar over the field of real numbers to a triangular matrix? If so, find such a triangular matrix.
2. Every matrix $A$ such that $A^2 = A$ is similar to a diagonal matrix.
3. Let $T$ be a diagonalizable linear operator on the $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, and let $W$ be a subspace which is invariant under $T$. Prove that the restriction operator $T_W$ is diagonalizable.
4. Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space over the field of complex numbers. Prove that $T$ is diagonalizable if and only if $T$ is annihilated by some polynomial over $\mathbb{C}$ which has distinct roots.
5. Let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. If every subspace of $V$ is invariant under $T$, then $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator.
6. Let $T$ be the indefinite integral operator
    $(Tf)(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \,dt$
