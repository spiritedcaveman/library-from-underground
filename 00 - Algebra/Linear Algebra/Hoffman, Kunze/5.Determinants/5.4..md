Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ skew-symmetric matrix over $\mathbb{C}$, i.e., $A^T = -A$, with $n$ odd. Then,
$$\det(A) = \det(A^T) = \det(-A) = (-1)^n \det(A).$$Since $n$ is odd, $(-1)^n = -1$, so$$\det(A) = -\det(A) \implies 2\det(A) = 0 \implies \det(A) = 0.$$
Thus, the determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix of odd order over a field of characteristic zero (such as $\mathbb{C}$) is zero.
