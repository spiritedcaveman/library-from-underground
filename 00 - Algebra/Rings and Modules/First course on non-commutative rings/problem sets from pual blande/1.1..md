(a) An element $e$ of $R$ is said to be idempotent if $e^2 = e$. Note that $R$ always has at least two idempotents, namely $0$ and $1$. Let $e$ be an idempotent element of $R$. Show that the set $eRe$ of all finite sums $\sum_{i=1}^n e a_i e$, where $a_i \in R$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$, is a ring with identity $e$. The integer $n$ is not fixed, that is, any two finite sums such as $\sum_{i=1}^m e a_i e$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n e b_i e$, with $m \neq n$, are in $eRe$. Show also that $eRe = \{ a \in R \mid ea = a = ae \}$.

Soln.
 Let $R$ be a ring and let $e \in R$ be idempotent, i.e., $e^2 = e$. Define
$$eRe := \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n e a_i e \mid a_i \in R,\ n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}.$$
1.  $eRe$ is a subring of $R$ with identity $e$.

* Closure under addition: If $x = \sum_{i=1}^m e a_i e$ and $y = \sum_{j=1}^n e b_j e$, then $x + y = \sum_{k=1}^{m+n} e c_k e \in eRe$ where $c_k = a_k$ for $1 \le k \le m$ and $c_k = b_{k-m}$ for $m+1 \le k \le m+n$, hence closed under addition.
* Additive inverses: For $x = \sum e a_i e$, $-x = \sum e (-a_i) e \in eRe$.
* Closure under multiplication: Let $x = \sum_i e a_i e$, $y = \sum_j e b_j e$, then
 $$xy = \left( \sum_i e a_i e \right) \left( \sum_j e b_j e \right) = \sum_{i,j} e a_i e b_j e = \sum_{i,j} e a_i (e b_j) e = \sum_{i,j} e a_i b_j e \in eRe,$$
since $e^2 = e$ and $R$ is associative.
* Multiplicative identity: Note $e = e \cdot 1 \cdot e \in eRe$ and for any $x = eae \in eRe$,
$$ex = e(eae) = (ee)ae = eae = x,$$       $$xe = (eae)e = ea(ee) = eae = x.$$
So $e$ acts as a multiplicative identity in $eRe$.

Thus, $eRe$ is a unital subring of $R$ with identity $e$.

# 2.
 $eRe = \{ a \in R \mid ea = a = ae \}$.

($\subseteq$) Let $x = \sum_{i=1}^n e a_i e \in eRe$. Then for each term $e a_i e$,
$$e(e a_i e) = (ee) a_i e = e a_i e,$$   $$(e a_i e)e = e a_i (ee) = e a_i e,$$
hence for $x$, we have $ex = x$ and $xe = x$.

($\supseteq$) Let $x \in R$ satisfy $ex = x = xe$. Then $x = ex = (ee)x = e(ex) = ex = x$, and $x = xe = x(ee) = (xe)e = xe = x$. Also, $x = ex = x$, so $x = ex = xe = exe \in eRe$.

Hence,
$$eRe = \{ a \in R \mid ea = a = ae \}.$$

(b) If $e$ and $f$ are idempotents of $R$, then $e$ and $f$ are said to be orthogonal idempotents if $ef = fe = 0$. If $\{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n\}$ is a set of pairwise orthogonal idempotents of $R$, prove that $e = e_1 + e_2 + \dots + e_n$ is an idempotent of $R$.

Soln.

Let $\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}$ be pairwise orthogonal idempotents in $R$, i.e., $e_i^2 = e_i$ and $e_i e_j = 0$ for $i \ne j$. Set $e = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i$. Then
 $e^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e_i \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n e_i \right) \left( \sum_{j=1}^n e_j \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n e_i e_j = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 + \sum_{i \ne j} e_i e_j = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i + \sum_{i \ne j} 0 = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i = e$


(c) If every element of $R$ is idempotent, then $R$ is said to be a boolean ring. Prove that a Boolean ring $R$ is commutative. (Hint: Consider $(a + a)^2$ and $(a + b)^2$, where $a, b \in R$.)

Soln.
$(x+y)=(x+y)^2=x^2+xy+yx+y^2$. Now, using the property that $x^2=x$ and $y^2=y$, we have $xy+yx=0$ so that $xy=-(yx)$. Also, since $x=x^2=(-x)^2=-x$, each element is its own additive inverse, i.e., $xy=yx$ so the ring is commutative.

# 5.
An element $a \in R$ is said to be $\textbf{nilpotent}$ if there is a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = 0$. The smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = 0$ is called the index of nilpotency of $a$.

(a) If $a$ is a nilpotent element of $R$, prove that $1 - a$ has a multiplicative inverse in $R$. (Hint: Factor $1 - a^n$, where $n$ is the index of nilpotency of $a$.)

Soln.
 Let $a \in R$ be nilpotent, so $a^n = 0$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Consider the geometric-like sum:
$$(1 - a)(1 + a + a^2 + \dots + a^{n-1}) = 1 - a^n = 1.$$Since $a^n = 0$, this becomes:$$(1 - a)(1 + a + a^2 + \dots + a^{n-1}) = 1.$$


(b) If $M_n(R)$ is the matrix ring of Example 2, let $(a_{ij}) \in M_n(R)$ be such that $a_{ij} = 0$ if $i \ge j$. Then $(a_{ij})$ is a strictly upper triangular matrix. Show that $(a_{ij})$ is nilpotent. In fact, show that $(a_{ij})^n = 0$. Conclude that, in general, $M_n(R)$ has an abundance of nonzero nilpotent elements.

Soln.
 Let $A = (a_{ij}) \in M_n(R)$ be a strictly upper triangular matrix, i.e., $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $i \geq j$. Then $A$ has nonzero entries only above the main diagonal. In matrix multiplication, each product $A^k$ shifts nonzero entries further above the diagonal. Since there are only $n$ rows and columns, after $n$ multiplications all nonzero entries will have shifted beyond the top-right corner, and hence $A^n = 0$. Thus, every strictly upper triangular matrix in $M_n(R)$ is nilpotent with index of nilpotency at most $n$.

Moreover, the set of strictly upper triangular matrices forms a nontrivial $R$-submodule of $M_n(R)$ of dimension $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which grows quadratically with $n$. Therefore, as $n$ increases, the space of nonzero nilpotent elements in $M_n(R)$ becomes increasingly large. This demonstrates that $M_n(R)$ has an abundance of nonzero nilpotent elements.

# 6.
Prove that if $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of $2 \times 2$ matrices of the form $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix}$, $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, then $\mathcal{C}$ is a subring of the matrix ring $M_2(\mathbb{R})$.

Soln.
 Let $A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix}, B = \begin{pmatrix} c & d \\ -d & c \end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{C}$.

Addition:
$$A + B = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} c & d \\ -d & c \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a+c & b+d \\ -(b+d) & a+c \end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{C}.$$Multiplication:$$AB = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} c & d \\ -d & c \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ac - bd & ad + bc \\ -bc - ad & -bd + ac \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ac - bd & ad + bc \\ -(ad + bc) & ac - bd \end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{C}.$$Additive inverse:$$-A = -\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -a & -b \\ b & -a \end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{C}.$$
So $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under addition, multiplication, and additive inverses.

# 7.
(a) Suppose that $q(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices of the form
 $$\begin{pmatrix} a + bi & c + di \\ -c + di & a - bi \end{pmatrix},$$
where $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i = \sqrt{-1}$. Prove that $q(\mathbb{R})$ is a noncommutative division ring that is a subring of $M_2(\mathbb{C})$. $q(\mathbb{R})$ is the ring of real quaternions. If $a, b, c$ and $d$ are rational numbers, then $q(\mathbb{Q})$ is also a division ring called the ring of rational quaternions and if $a, b, c$ and $d$ are integers, then $q(\mathbb{Z})$ is the ring of integral quaternions. The ring $q(\mathbb{Z})$ has no zero divisors, but $q(\mathbb{Z})$ is not a division ring.

Soln. 
 Let
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} a + bi & c + di \\ -c + di & a - bi \end{pmatrix} \in q(\mathbb{R}).$$
Subring:

Addition and multiplication of such matrices keep the same form (check directly), and additive inverses clearly exist. So $q(\mathbb{R})$ is a subring of $M_2(\mathbb{C})$.

Division ring:

For $A \ne 0$, define the conjugate:
$$A^* = \begin{pmatrix} a - bi & -c - di \\ c - di & a + bi \end{pmatrix}.$$Then
$$AA^* = A^*A = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)I \ne 0.$$So
$$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2} A^* \in q(\mathbb{R}).$$
Thus, every nonzero element is invertible.

Noncommutative:

E.g., set $b=1, c=1, a=d=0$ in two matrices and compute product both waysâ€”get different results.

So $q(\mathbb{R})$ is a noncommutative division ring.

Extra:

$q(\mathbb{Q})$: same structure with rationals $\rightarrow$ division ring.
$q(\mathbb{Z})$: closed under operations, no zero divisors (as in integers), but inverses are not always in $q(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow$ not a division ring.

(b) Let $1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $i = \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{pmatrix}$, $j = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $k = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Prove that every element of $q(\mathbb{R})$ has a unique expression of the form $a_1 1 + a_2 i + a_3 j + a_4 k$, where $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \in \mathbb{R}$.


Soln.
 Let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \in \mathbb{R}$. Then compute:
$a_1 1 + a_2 i + a_3 j + a_4 k = a_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + a_2 \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{pmatrix} + a_3 \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + a_4 \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\ = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 & 0 \\ 0 & a_1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} a_2 i & 0 \\ 0 & -a_2 i \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 & a_3 \\ -a_3 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 & a_4 i \\ a_4 i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \\ = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 + a_2 i & a_3 + a_4 i \\ -a_3 + a_4 i & a_1 - a_2 i \end{pmatrix} \in q(\mathbb{R})$
This matches the general form in part (a), so every element of $q(\mathbb{R})$ can be written in this form.

Uniqueness: The matrices $1, i, j, k$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$ (easy to check), so the expression is unique.

$\therefore$ Every element of $q(\mathbb{R})$ has a unique expression as $a_1 1 + a_2 i + a_3 j + a_4 k$.

(c) Show that $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1$ and that
$$ij = -ji = k,  jk = -kj = i, \quad \text{and} \quad ki = -ik = j.$$

# 8. 
   (a) Let $n$ be an integer such that $n = m^2 n'$ for some integers $m$ and $n'$, where $n'$ is square free. The integer $n'$ is said to be the square free part of $n$. If the requirement that $n$ is a square free integer is dropped from Example 10, show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n'})$ are the same quadratic fields. Conclude that one need only use the square free part of $n$ to compute $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$.
Soln.
 Let $n = m^2 n'$, where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, $n' \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $n'$ is square-free.
Then:
$$\sqrt{n} = \sqrt{m^2 n'} = |m| \sqrt{n'}.$$So any element in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ is of the form:$$a + b\sqrt{n} = a + b|m|\sqrt{n'} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n'}).$$Conversely, any $a + b\sqrt{n'} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n'})$ can be written as:$$a + b\sqrt{n'} = a + \frac{b}{|m|}\sqrt{n} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}).$$Thus, both fields contain the same elements:$$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n'}).$$

---
 (b) If $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}] = \{a + b\sqrt{n} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$, show that $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}]$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$. Conclude that $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}]$ is an integral domain.

Soln.
Let $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}] = \{a + b\sqrt{n} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$.
Subring:

* Closed under addition:
$$(a + b\sqrt{n}) + (c + d\sqrt{n}) = (a + c) + (b + d)\sqrt{n} \in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}].$$
* Closed under multiplication:
$$(a + b\sqrt{n})(c + d\sqrt{n}) = (ac + bdn) + (ad + bc)\sqrt{n} \in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}].$$
* Contains $0 = 0 + 0\sqrt{n}$, $1 = 1 + 0\sqrt{n}$, and additive inverses $-(a + b\sqrt{n}) = -a + (-b)\sqrt{n}$.



**Integral domain:**

Suppose $(a + b\sqrt{n})(c + d\sqrt{n}) = 0$ with both factors nonzero.

Then expand:
$$(ac + bdn) + (ad + bc)\sqrt{n} = 0.$$So both parts must be zero:
$$ac + bdn = 0, \quad ad + bc = 0.$$Now argue:
* If $b = 0$, then $a \ne 0$, and $ad = 0 \Rightarrow d = 0$, and $ac = 0 \Rightarrow c = 0$, so the second term is zero $\rightarrow$ contradiction.
* Similarly if $d = 0$.
* Otherwise, both $b, d \ne 0$: consider the norm $N(x + y\sqrt{n}) = x^2 - ny^2$. If $(a + b\sqrt{n})(c + d\sqrt{n}) = 0$, then $N((a + b\sqrt{n})(c + d\sqrt{n})) = N(a + b\sqrt{n}) N(c + d\sqrt{n}) = 0$. If $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}]$ were embedded in $\mathbb{C}$, and $n > 0$, then $a+b\sqrt{n}=0 \iff a=b=0$. If $n < 0$, then $a+b\sqrt{n}=0 \iff a=b=0$. Since the factors are nonzero, this leads to a contradiction.

Thus, $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}]$ has no zero divisors.
$\therefore \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{n}]$ is an integral domain.

# 9.
(a) If $\{R_\alpha\}_{\Delta}$ is a family of subrings of $R$, prove that $\bigcap_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ is a subring of $R$.

Soln.
Let $\{R_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Delta}$ be a family of subrings of a ring $R$. Define $S := \bigcap_{\alpha \in \Delta} R_\alpha$. Since each $R_\alpha$ contains $0$ and $1$ and is closed under addition, additive inverses, and multiplication, these properties are preserved under intersection. Thus, $S$ contains $0$, $1$, is closed under $+$, $-$, and $\cdot$, hence is a subring of $R$.

---

(b) Suppose that the subrings of a ring $R$ are ordered by $\subseteq$. If $S$ is a subset of $R$ and $\{R_\alpha\}_{\Delta}$ is the family of subrings of $R$ that contain $S$, show that $\bigcap_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ is the smallest subring of $R$ containing $S$. The subring $\bigcap_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ is called the subring of $R$ generated by $S$.
Soln.

Now suppose $T \subseteq R$ is any subring containing $S$. Then $T \in \{R_\alpha\}$, so:
$$\bigcap_{\alpha \in \Delta} R_\alpha \subseteq T.$$Hence, $\bigcap_{\alpha \in \Delta} R_\alpha$ is the smallest subring of $R$ containing $S$.
# 10.
Let $R$ be a ring and let $\operatorname{cent}(R) = \{b \in R \mid ba = ab \text{ for all } a \in R\}$.
(a) If $a \in R$, show that $C(a) = \{b \in R \mid ba = ab\}$ is a subring of $R$.

Soln.

* Nonempty: $0 \in C(a)$ since $0 \cdot a = a \cdot 0 = 0$.
* Closed under addition: If $b_1, b_2 \in C(a)$, then
$$(b_1 + b_2)a = b_1a + b_2a = ab_1 + ab_2 = a(b_1 + b_2) \Rightarrow b_1 + b_2 \in C(a).$$
* Closed under multiplication:
$$(b_1b_2)a = b_1(b_2a) = b_1(ab_2) = (b_1a)b_2 = (ab_1)b_2 = a(b_1b_2) \Rightarrow b_1b_2 \in C(a).$$
* Closed under additive inverses: If $b \in C(a)$, then
$$(-b)a = -(ba) = -(ab) = a(-b) \Rightarrow -b \in C(a).$$

So $C(a)$ is a subring of $R$.

---
(b) Verify that $\operatorname{cent}(R) = \bigcap_{a \in R} C(a)$. The subring $\operatorname{cent}(R)$ is called the center of $R$.
Soln.
 By definition,
$$\operatorname{cent}(R) = \{ b \in R \mid ba = ab \text{ for all } a \in R \} = \bigcap_{a \in R} C(a).$$
That is, $b \in \operatorname{cent}(R)$ iff $b \in C(a)$ for every $a \in R$.

---
(c) If $a \in R$ is a unit in $R$, prove that if $a \in \operatorname{cent}(R)$, then $a^{-1} \in \operatorname{cent}(R)$. Conclude that if $R$ is a division ring, then $\operatorname{cent}(R)$ is a field.

Soln.
Let $a \in \operatorname{cent}(R)$, so for all $r \in R$,
$$ar = ra.$$Since $a$ is a unit, multiply both sides on the left by $a^{-1}$:
$$a^{-1}ar = a^{-1}ra \Rightarrow r = a^{-1}ra.$$Now multiply both sides on the right by $a^{-1}$:
$$ra^{-1} = a^{-1}r.$$So $a^{-1} \in \operatorname{cent}(R)$.
Conclusion: If $R$ is a division ring, then every nonzero element in $\operatorname{cent}(R)$ has its inverse also in $\operatorname{cent}(R)$.

So $\operatorname{cent}(R)$ is a commutative division ring, i.e., a field.
