The ring $\prod_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ is called the $\textbf{ring direct product}$ of $\{R_\alpha\}_{\Delta}$. Since each $R_\alpha$ has an identity, $\prod_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ has an identity $(1_\alpha)$, where each $1_\alpha$ is the identity of $R_\alpha$. $\prod_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ is commutative if and only if each $R_\alpha$ is commutative, but $\prod_{\Delta} R_\alpha$ is never an integral domain even if each $R_\alpha$ is. For example, $\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain, but $(1, 0)(0, 1) = (0, 0)$ in $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$.

$\mathbb{Z} \times 0$ is not a subring of $\Bbb{Z} \times \Bbb{Z}$ 

6.  **The Opposite Ring.** If $R$ is a ring, then we can construct a new ring called the $\textbf{opposite ring}$ of $R$, denoted by $R^{op}$. As sets, $R = R^{op}$ and the additive structures on both rings are the same. Multiplication $\circ$ is defined on $R^{op}$ by $a \circ b = ba$, where $ba$ is multiplication in $R$. Clearly, if $R$ is commutative, then $R$ and $R^{op}$ are the same ring.
   
   $R \times M \to M, \text{ written } (r, m) \mapsto r \cdot m$

$\operatorname{End}_R(M): \text{ Set of } R\text{-module homomorphisms } f: M \to M$

$\operatorname{End}_R(M) \times R \to \operatorname{End}_R(M), \text{ defined by } (f, r) \mapsto f \cdot r$

$R^{\text{op}} \times \operatorname{End}_R(M) \to \operatorname{End}_R(M), \text{ defined by } (a, f) \mapsto a * f,$
