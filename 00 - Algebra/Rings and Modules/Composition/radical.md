If $R$ is a commutative ring and $I$ is an ideal of $R$, then $\sqrt{I} = \{a \in R \mid a^n \in I \text{ for some integer } n \ge 1 \}$ is called the radical of $I$.


radical of an ideal is bigger inclusion wise

when radical of an ideal is same as ideal, we call it radical ideal, prime ideals are proper subset of this class; that is to say there are non prime radical ideals
