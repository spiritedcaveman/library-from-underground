Show that every compact space is Lindelöf, and find some examples of Lindelöf spaces that are not compact.
# 2.

 Show that a discrete topological space is compact if and only if it is finite, and Lindelöf if and only if it is countable.
# 3.

 Show that $\omega_1$ is not Lindelöf.
# 4.

Show that every compact Hausdorff space is normal.
# 5.

 Show that if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is Hausdorff and $K \subseteq X$ is compact, then $K$ is closed.
# 6.

 Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a compact topological space and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}_{usual}$ be a continuous function. Show that $f(X)$ is bounded.

Prove the Extreme Value Theorem: every continuous function $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ achieves a minimum and maximum.
# 8.

 Show that $\omega_1 + 1$ is compact.
