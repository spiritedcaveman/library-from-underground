 Fix $x\in\mathbb{X}\setminus K$. Since $\mathbb{X}$ is Hausdorff, for each $y\in K$ there are disjoint open sets $U_y$ and $V_y$ such that $x\in U_y$ and $y\in V_y$. $\{V_y:y\in K\}$ is an open cover of $K$, so it has a finite subcover, say $\{V_y:y\in F\}$, where $F$ is some finite subset of $K$. Let $$U=\bigcap_{y\in F}U_y\;;$$ clearly $U$ is an open nbhd of $x$ disjoint from $K$. Since $x$ was an arbitrary point of $\mathbb{X}\setminus K$, $K$ must be closed.

 Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a compact topological space and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}_{usual}$ be a continuous function. Show that $f(X)$ is bounded and in fact it achieves a minimum and a maximum.


Soln.
 Let $\mathcal{U}_n = (-\infty, n) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{U}_n = \mathbb{R}$.

In particular, if $f$ is continuous, then each $f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ is open in $X$, and:
$$X = f^{-1}(\mathbb{R}) = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_n).$$This gives an open cover of $X$, and since $X$ is compact, there's a finite subcover:$$X = \bigcup_{j=1}^k f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_{m_j}).$$Assume $m_1 < \dots < m_k$. Then:$$X = f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_{m_k}) \Rightarrow f(x) < m_k \text{ for all } x \in X,$$
so $f$ is bounded above by $m_k$.





Since $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $X$ is compact, the image $f(X)$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}$.

A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded (this is the Heine-Borel theorem in $\mathbb{R}$).

Since $f(X)$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$, it contains its supremum (the maximum value) and its infimum (the minimum value). Therefore, $f$ achieves its maximum and minimum values on $X$.
