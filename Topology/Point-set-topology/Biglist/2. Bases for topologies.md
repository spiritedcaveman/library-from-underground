Show explicitly that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a < b \}$ is a basis, and that it generates the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
 
 Soln.
This covers the whole $\mathbb{R}$ and also any intersection would be a open set.

# 2.
  Show that the collection $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}} := \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, a < b \}$ is a basis for the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
 
Soln.
There will be countably many open sets and it will surely cover $\mathbb{R}$ for $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in it.
Also intersections will be trivially open.

  Some exercises about the Sorgenfrey line.
Recall that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ [a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a < b \}$ is a basis which generates $\mathcal{S}$, the Lower Limit Topology. The space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{S})$ is called the Sorgenfrey line. We will reference several of these exercises later when we explore properties of this space.

   (a) Show that every nonempty open set in $\mathcal{S}$ contains a rational number.
Soln.
Let $U$ be a nonempty open set in the Sorgenfrey topology $\mathcal{S}$. Then $U$ contains a basis element $[a, b)$ with $a < b$. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, there exists $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < q < b$. Then $q \in [a, b) \subseteq U$, so $U$ contains a rational number.

   (b) Show that the interval $(0, 1)$ is open in the Sorgenfrey line.
Soln.

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define $U_n = \left[\frac{1}{n}, 0\right)$. Then $U_n$ is open in $\mathcal{S}$, and $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n = (0,1)$. Hence, $(0,1)$ is a union of open sets in $\mathcal{S}$ and is therefore open.

   (c) More generally, show that for any $a < b \in \mathbb{R}$, $(a, b)$ is open in the Sorgenfrey line.
Soln.
For $a < b$, define $U_n = [a + \tfrac{1}{n}, b)$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Each $U_n$ is open in $\mathcal{S}$, and $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n = (a, b)$, so $(a, b)$ is open in $\mathcal{S}$.

   (d) Is the interval $(0, 1]$ open in $\mathcal{S}$?
Soln.
 No; $(0,1]$ is not open in $\mathcal{S}$ because any open set in $\mathcal{S}$ containing $1$ must include some interval of the form $[c,1)$, but such sets never contain $1$, so no basis element around $1$ is contained in $(0,1]$.
 
   (e) Show that $\mathcal{S}$ strictly refines the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
 Soln.
  $(a, b)$ which is basis regular topology and $\left[\frac{1}{n}, 0\right)$ is not in regular are both in $\mathcal{S}$
  
   (f) Show that the real numbers can be written as the union of two disjoint, nonempty open sets in $\mathcal{S}$.
Soln.
  Let $U = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} [2n, 2n+1)$ and $V = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} [2n+1, 2n+2)$. Then $U$ and $V$ are disjoint, nonempty, open in $\mathcal{S}$, and $U \cup V = \mathbb{R}$, so $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets in $\mathcal{S}$.

   (g) Let $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}} := \{ [a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, a < b \}$. Show that $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is not a basis for the Lower Limit Topology.
Soln.
   $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is not a basis for $\mathcal{S}$ because it fails to generate all open sets in $\mathcal{S}$. For example, $[\sqrt{2}, 2)$ is open in $\mathcal{S}$, but cannot be written as a union of sets from $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ since no $[a,b) \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ satisfies $a = \sqrt{2}$. So $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ does not form a basis for $\mathcal{S}$.
   
   
  So, in any such attempted basis $\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{Q}$, you’ll always end up "approximating from the left" — but **never including** the irrational point as the **left endpoint** of any basis element. That means:

* You can cover neighborhoods *around* irrational points,
* But you **can’t generate open sets like** $[\sqrt{2}, b)$,
* So $\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{Q}$ **misses some opens** in $\mathcal{S}$.

So yes — irrational points will be “unreachable” as left endpoints in the basic open sets, which prevents the collection from being a true basis for the topology.

# 4.
 Recall that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ \{x\} : x \in X \}$ is a basis for the discrete topology on a set $X$. If $X$ is a finite set with $n$ elements, then clearly $\mathcal{B}$ also has $n$ elements. Is there a basis with fewer than $n$ elements that generates the discrete topology on $X$?
 
 Soln.
 No, there is not a basis with fewer than $n$ elements that generates the discrete topology on a finite set $X$ with $n$ elements.
 
In the discrete topology, every singleton ${x}$ must be open, and every subset of $X$ must be a union of basis elements. If a basis does not contain all $n$ singletons, then at least one singleton ${x}$ must be formed by a union of other basis elements. But any union of sets not equal to ${x}$ will either

# 5.
Let $X = [0, 1]^{[0,1]}$, the set of all functions $f : [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$. Given a subset $A \subseteq [0, 1]$, let
$$U_A = \{ f \in X : f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } x \in A \} .$$
Show that $\mathcal{B} := \{U_A : A \subseteq [0, 1] \}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$.

Soln.
Since $X$ is the collection of all functions that take $[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ then $\forall f \in X \, \exists x \in [0,1]$ s.t $f(x) = 0$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is exactly a collection of sets that go to 0 at some point in $[0,1]$, it covers all of $X$.

Take any $f \in X$. Let $A = { x \in [0,1] : f(x) = 0 }$. Then $f \in U_A$. So every function is in at least one $U_A$, i.e., $X = \bigcup \mathcal{B}$.

Suppose $f \in U_A \cap U_B$. Then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in A \cup B$, so $f \in U_{A \cup B}$, and clearly $U_{A \cup B} \subseteq U_A \cap U_B$.

# ** 6.
Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis on a set $X$, and let $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$ be the topology it generates. Show that
$$\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} = \bigcap \{ \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X) : \mathcal{T} \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ and } \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T} \} .$$
That is, show that $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$ is the intersection of all topologies that contain $\mathcal{B}$.

Soln.

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be any topology on $X$ such that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$. Since topologies are closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, and $\mathcal{T}$ contains all basis elements, it must also contain all unions of basis elements — i.e., all elements of $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$. Thus, $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} \subseteq \bigcap \{ \mathcal{T} : \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T} \text{ and } \mathcal{T} \text{ is a topology} \}$.

On the other hand, $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$ is itself a topology containing $\mathcal{B}$, so it is one of the topologies in the intersection — hence the smallest such. Therefore, equality holds.

# ** 7.
Let $\{ \mathcal{T}_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of topologies on a set $X$, where $I$ is some indexing set. Prove that there is a unique coarsest topology that refines all the $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$'s. That is, prove that there is a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ such that
(a) $\mathcal{T}$ refines $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for every $\alpha \in I$.
Soln.

Let $\mathcal{T} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \mathcal{T}_\alpha$. Then:
Each $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is a topology, so their intersection is closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions, hence also a topology.

$\mathcal{T}$ is contained in every $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$, i.e., it refines each $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$.

(b) If $\mathcal{T}'$ is another topology that refines $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for every $\alpha \in I$, then $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$.
Soln.
If any other topology $\mathcal{T}'$ refines all the $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$, then $\mathcal{T}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, so $\mathcal{T}$ is the coarsest such.
Hence, $\mathcal{T} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is the unique coarsest topology refining all the $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$.
# ** 8.
Let $m, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $m \neq 0$. Recall that a set of the form $Z(m, b) = \{ mx + b : x \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is called an arithmetic progression. Show that the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all arithmetic progressions is a basis on $\mathbb{Z}$.
The topology $\mathcal{T}_{Furst}$ that $\mathcal{B}$ generates is called the Furstenberg topology. This is an interesting topology we will use later to give a very novel proof of the infinitude of the primes.

**(1) Covering:**

Each integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ lies in the arithmetic progression $Z(1, n) = \{1 \cdot x + n : x \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \mathbb{Z}$. So every $n$ is in some $Z(m, b) \in \mathcal{B}$. Thus, $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = \mathbb{Z}$.

**(2) Basis Condition:**

Suppose $x \in Z(m_1, b_1) \cap Z(m_2, b_2)$. Then $x \equiv b_1 \pmod{m_1}$ and $x \equiv b_2 \pmod{m_2}$.

By the ==Chinese Remainder Theorem==, there exists $d = \mathrm{lcm}(m_1, m_2)$ and some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x \in Z(d, c) \subseteq Z(m_1, b_1) \cap Z(m_2, b_2)$.

(a) Describe the open sets of this topology (qualitatively).
Open sets in the Furstenberg topology are **not** intervals like $(m, n) \cap \mathbb{Z}$. Rather, they are **unions of arithmetic progressions** — sets of the form $Z(m, b) = \{ mx + b : x \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ with $m \ne 0$. So open sets consist of integers that follow regular congruence patterns, not necessarily consecutive integers. For example, the set of all even integers is open, as is any union like $Z(2, 0) \cup Z(3, 1)$, but intervals such as $\{3, 4, 5\}$ are not open unless they can be written as such a union, which they usually can’t.


(b) Show that every nonempty open set in $\mathcal{T}_{Furst}$ is infinite.
(c) Let $U \in \mathcal{B}$ be a basic open set. Show that $\mathbb{Z} \setminus U$ is open.
(d) Show that for any pair of distinct integers $m$ and $n$, there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $m \in U$ and $n \in V$.

For the next three problems, we’re going to define a new idea. In lectures we said that a basis can be a convenient way of specifying a topology so we don’t have to list out all the open sets. Now we’ll extend this idea by defining a convenient way of specifying a basis. This isn’t always more convenient than just listing the elements of the basis, but often is.

**Definition 2.1.** Let $X$ be a set. A collection $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ is called a subbasis on $X$ if the collection of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ is a basis on $X$. That is, if
$$\mathcal{B} := \{ S_1 \cap \dots \cap S_n : n \in \mathbb{N}, S_1, \dots, S_n \in \mathcal{S} \}$$
is a basis on $X$. This basis is called the basis generated by $\mathcal{S}$.

The topology generated by the basis generated by $\mathcal{S}$ is called the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$, as you might expect.

# ** 9.
Show that the collection
$$\mathcal{S} := \{ (-\infty, b) : b \in \mathbb{R} \} \cup \{ (a, \infty) : a \in \mathbb{R} \}$$
is a subbasis that generates the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

Soln.
Observe that finite intersections of elements in $\mathcal{S}$ are either empty (if $b \le a$) or of the form $(a, b)$ for $a < b$, which are open intervals forming a basis for the usual topology. Since the topology generated by a subbasis is the collection of all unions of finite intersections of its elements, and the collection of open intervals $(a, b)$ generates the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$, it follows that the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ is precisely the usual topology.

---
# ** 10.
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a collection of subsets of a set $X$ that covers $X$. That is, $X = \bigcup_{S \in \mathcal{S}} S$. Show that $\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis on $X$. Give an example of a subbasis on $\mathbb{R}$ that does not generate the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

Soln.
Since $\mathcal{S}$ covers $X$, we can define a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ by taking as a sub-basis $\mathcal{S}$, and generating $\mathcal{T}$ as all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$. That is the definition of a subbasis. So any cover of $X$ by subsets can serve as a subbasis for a topology on $X$, though not necessarily the standard one.

Example: Let $\mathcal{S} = \{(a, \infty) : a \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Then $\mathcal{S}$ covers $\mathbb{R}$ and thus is a subbasis. But the topology it generates is not the usual topology, since it lacks intervals of the form $(a,b)$ (e.g., no open neighborhoods bounded above). This gives a proper coarser topology called the right-ray topology.

# ** 11.
For a prime number $p$, let $S_p = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : n \text{ is a multiple of } p \}$.
   (a) Show that $\mathcal{S} := \{ S_p : p \text{ is prime } \} \cup \{\{1\}\}$ is a subbasis on $\mathbb{N}$.


   (b) Describe the open sets in the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ (qualitatively).

# 12.
Fix an infinite subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ whose complement $\mathbb{Z} \setminus A$ is also infinite. Construct a topology on $\mathbb{Z}$ in which:
 (a) $A$ is open.
 (b) Singletons are never open (i.e., for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\{n\}$ is not open).
 (c) For any pair of distinct integers $m$ and $n$, there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $m \in U$ and $n \in V$.
