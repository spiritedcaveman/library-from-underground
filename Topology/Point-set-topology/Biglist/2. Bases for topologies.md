Show explicitly that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a < b \}$ is a basis, and that it generates the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

# 2.
  Show that the collection $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}} := \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, a < b \}$ is a basis for the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

  Some exercises about the Sorgenfrey line.
Recall that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ [a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a < b \}$ is a basis which generates $\mathcal{S}$, the Lower Limit Topology. The space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{S})$ is called the Sorgenfrey line. We will reference several of these exercises later when we explore properties of this space.
   (a) Show that every nonempty open set in $\mathcal{S}$ contains a rational number.
   (b) Show that the interval $(0, 1)$ is open in the Sorgenfrey line.
   (c) More generally, show that for any $a < b \in \mathbb{R}$, $(a, b)$ is open in the Sorgenfrey line.
   (d) Is the interval $(0, 1]$ open in $\mathcal{S}$?
   (e) Show that $\mathcal{S}$ strictly refines the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
   (f) Show that the real numbers can be written as the union of two disjoint, nonempty open sets in $\mathcal{S}$.
   (g) Let $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}} := \{ [a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, a < b \}$. Show that $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is not a basis for the Lower Limit Topology.

# 4.
 Recall that the collection $\mathcal{B} = \{ \{x\} : x \in X \}$ is a basis for the discrete topology on a set $X$. If $X$ is a finite set with $n$ elements, then clearly $\mathcal{B}$ also has $n$ elements. Is there a basis with fewer than $n$ elements that generates the discrete topology on $X$?
 
# 5.
Let $X = [0, 1]^{[0,1]}$, the set of all functions $f : [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$. Given a subset $A \subseteq [0, 1]$, let
$$U_A = \{ f \in X : f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } x \in A \} .$$
Show that $\mathcal{B} := \{U_A : A \subseteq [0, 1] \}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$.

# 6.
Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis on a set $X$, and let $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$ be the topology it generates. Show that
$$\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} = \bigcap \{ \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X) : \mathcal{T} \text{ is a topology on } X \text{ and } \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T} \} .$$
That is, show that $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$ is the intersection of all topologies that contain $\mathcal{B}$.

# 7.
Let $\{ \mathcal{T}_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of topologies on a set $X$, where $I$ is some indexing set. Prove that there is a unique coarsest topology that refines all the $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$'s. That is, prove that there is a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ such that
(a) $\mathcal{T}$ refines $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for every $\alpha \in I$.
(b) If $\mathcal{T}'$ is another topology that refines $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for every $\alpha \in I$, then $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$.

# 8.
Let $m, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $m \neq 0$. Recall that a set of the form $Z(m, b) = \{ mx + b : x \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is called an arithmetic progression. Show that the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all arithmetic progressions is a basis on $\mathbb{Z}$.
The topology $\mathcal{T}_{Furst}$ that $\mathcal{B}$ generates is called the Furstenberg topology. This is an interesting topology we will use later to give a very novel proof of the infinitude of the primes.
(a) Describe the open sets of this topology (qualitatively).
(b) Show that every nonempty open set in $\mathcal{T}_{Furst}$ is infinite.
(c) Let $U \in \mathcal{B}$ be a basic open set. Show that $\mathbb{Z} \setminus U$ is open.
(d) Show that for any pair of distinct integers $m$ and $n$, there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $m \in U$ and $n \in V$.

For the next three problems, we’re going to define a new idea. In lectures we said that a basis can be a convenient way of specifying a topology so we don’t have to list out all the open sets. Now we’ll extend this idea by defining a convenient way of specifying a basis. This isn’t always more convenient than just listing the elements of the basis, but often is.

Definition 2.1. Let $X$ be a set. A collection $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ is called a subbasis on $X$ if the collection of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ is a basis on $X$. That is, if
$$\mathcal{B} := \{ S_1 \cap \dots \cap S_n : n \in \mathbb{N}, S_1, \dots, S_n \in \mathcal{S} \}$$
is a basis on $X$. This basis is called the basis generated by $\mathcal{S}$.
The topology generated by the basis generated by $\mathcal{S}$ is called the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$, as you might expect.

# 9.
Show that the collection
$$\mathcal{S} := \{ (-\infty, b) : b \in \mathbb{R} \} \cup \{ (a, \infty) : a \in \mathbb{R} \}$$
is a subbasis that generates the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

# 10.
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a collection of subsets of a set $X$ that covers $X$. That is, $X = \bigcup_{S \in \mathcal{S}} S$. Show that $\mathcal{S}$ is a subbasis on $X$. Give an example of a subbasis on $\mathbb{R}$ that does not generate the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

# 11.
For a prime number $p$, let $S_p = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : n \text{ is a multiple of } p \}$.
   (a) Show that $\mathcal{S} := \{ S_p : p \text{ is prime } \} \cup \{\{1\}\}$ is a subbasis on $\mathbb{N}$.
   (b) Describe the open sets in the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ (qualitatively).

# 12.
Fix an infinite subset $A$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ whose complement $\mathbb{Z} \setminus A$ is also infinite. Construct a topology on $\mathbb{Z}$ in which:
 (a) $A$ is open.
 (b) Singletons are never open (i.e., for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\{n\}$ is not open).
 (c) For any pair of distinct integers $m$ and $n$, there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $m \in U$ and $n \in V$.
