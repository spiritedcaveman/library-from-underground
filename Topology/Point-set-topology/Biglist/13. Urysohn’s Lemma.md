This section is mostly a placeholder to keep the Big List sections aligned with the Lecture Notes
sections.

# 1.

 Show that the Tietze Extension Theorem implies Urysohn’s Lemma.

# 2.

 Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, thought of as a topological space with the topology generated by d. Then we know that X is metrizable and therefore normal. Prove Urysohn’s Lemma for this space directly, using an associated bounded metric d.
