  **Prove that every Hausdorff space is T1, and that every T1 space is T0.**


    **Hausdorff $\implies$ T1:** Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a Hausdorff space. For any two distinct points $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$, since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. Since $U$ is an open set containing $x$ but not $y$ (as $U \cap V = \emptyset$), and $V$ is an open set containing $y$ but not $x$, the space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ satisfies the definition of a T1 space.

  

    **T1 $\implies$ T0:** Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a T1 space. For any two distinct points $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$, since $X$ is T1, there exists an open set $U$ containing $x$ but not $y$. This satisfies the condition for a T0 space (we found an open set containing one of the points but not the other). Therefore, every T1 space is T0.

  
# 2.

  **Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a T1 topological space, and let $x \in X$. Show the constant sequence $x, x, x, x, \dots$ converges to $x$ and to no other point.**

  

    **Convergence to $x$:** Let $U$ be any open set containing $x$. For any $N \in \mathbb{N}$, the terms of the constant sequence $x_n = x$ for all $n \ge N$ are in $U$. Therefore, by the definition of convergence, the constant sequence converges to $x$.

  

    **Convergence to no other point $y \neq x$:** Suppose the constant sequence also converges to some $y \in X$ where $y \neq x$. Since $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is T1, for $x \neq y$, there exists an open set $V$ containing $y$ such that $x \notin V$. By the definition of convergence, since the sequence converges to $y$, for any open set $V$ containing $y$, there must exist some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \ge N$, $x_n \in V$. In our case, $x_n = x$ for all $n$, so we must have $x \in V$. However, we chose $V$ such that $x \notin V$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the constant sequence cannot converge to any point other than $x$.

  
# 3.

  **Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. Prove that the following are equivalent.**

    **(a) $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is T1.**

    **(b) For every $x \in X$, $\{x\}$ is closed.**

    **(c) Every constant sequence in $X$ converges only to its constant value.**

    **(d) Every finite subset of $X$ is closed.**

    **(e) For every subset $A \subseteq X$, $\overline{A} = \bigcap \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open and } A \subseteq U \}$.**

  

    **(a) $\iff$ (b):**

    $(\implies)$ Assume $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is T1. Let $x \in X$. To show $\{x\}$ is closed, we show that its complement $X \setminus \{x\}$ is open. Let $y \in X \setminus \{x\}$, so $y \neq x$. Since $X$ is T1, there exists an open set $V_y$ containing $y$ such that $x \notin V_y$, i.e., $V_y \subseteq X \setminus \{x\}$. Then $X \setminus \{x\} = \bigcup_{y \in X \setminus \{x\}} V_y$, which is a union of open sets, hence open. Thus, $\{x\}$ is closed for every $x \in X$.

    $(\impliedby)$ Assume that for every $x \in X$, $\{x\}$ is closed. Let $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Since $\{y\}$ is closed, its complement $X \setminus \{y\}$ is open and contains $x$. Similarly, since $\{x\}$ is closed, $X \setminus \{x\}$ is open and contains $y$. Thus, there exists an open set ($X \setminus \{y\}$) containing $x$ but not $y$, and an open set ($X \setminus \{x\}$) containing $y$ but not $x$. Therefore, $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is T1.

  

    **(b) $\iff$ (c):**

    $(\implies)$ Assume for every $x \in X$, $\{x\}$ is closed. Let the constant sequence be $x, x, x, \dots$. We showed in problem 2 that it converges only to $x$.

    $(\impliedby)$ Assume every constant sequence in $X$ converges only to its constant value. Let $y \neq x$. The constant sequence $y, y, y, \dots$ converges only to $y$. If $\{x\}$ were not closed, then $y \in \overline{\{x\}}$ for some $y \neq x$. This means every open set containing $y$ also contains $x$. Consider any open set $V$ containing $y$. Then $x \in V$, so the constant sequence $y, y, \dots$ has terms in $V$ from some point onwards (in fact, always). This doesn't directly give a contradiction.

  

    Let's retry (b) $\implies$ (c): Assume $\{x\}$ is closed for all $x \in X$. Let the constant sequence $x_n = x$ converge to $y$. If $y \neq x$, then by (b), $\{x\}$ is closed, so $X \setminus \{x\}$ is open and contains $y$. Since $x_n \to y$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \ge N$, $x_n \in X \setminus \{x\}$. But $x_n = x$, so $x \in X \setminus \{x\}$, a contradiction. Thus, $y = x$.

  

    Let's retry (c) $\implies$ (b): Assume every constant sequence converges only to its constant value. Suppose $\{x\}$ is not closed. Then there exists $y \neq x$ such that $y \in \overline{\{x\}}$. This means every open set $U$ containing $y$ also contains $x$. Consider the constant sequence $x, x, x, \dots$. It converges to $x$. If it also converges to $y$, we have a contradiction with (c). Let $U$ be any open set containing $y$. Since $x \in U$, the terms of the sequence are eventually in $U$ (in fact, always). So the constant sequence $x, x, \dots$ converges to $y$. By (c), we must have $y = x$, which contradicts our assumption that $y \neq x$. Therefore, $\{x\}$ must be closed.

  

    **(b) $\iff$ (d):**

    $(\implies)$ Assume every singleton $\{x\}$ is closed. Let $F = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ be a finite subset of $X$. Then $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \{x_i\}$. Since each $\{x_i\}$ is closed and a finite union of closed sets is closed, $F$ is closed.

    $(\impliedby)$ A singleton set $\{x\}$ is a finite subset of $X$, so by (d), it is closed.

  

    **(b) $\iff$ (e):**

    $(\implies)$ Assume every singleton $\{x\}$ is closed. Let $A \subseteq X$. We know $\overline{A} = \bigcap \{C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed and } A \subseteq C \}$. We need to show $\bigcap \{C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed and } A \subseteq C \} = \bigcap \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open and } A \subseteq U \}$. This is clearly false. The closure is the intersection of closed sets, not open sets.

  

    Let's correct (e). The closure of $A$ is the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$.

    We need to show (b) $\iff$ (something related to closure).

  

    Consider the definition of closure: $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$.

    (b) $\implies$ (something about closure). If singletons are closed, then finite sets are closed.

  

    Let's consider the definition of limit points: $x \in \overline{A}$ iff every open set containing $x$ intersects $A$.

  

    Let's go back to the original statement of (e). It seems incorrect as stated. It should likely involve closed sets.

  

    Let's consider the properties of T1 spaces and closure. In a T1 space, $\overline{\{x\}} = \{x\}$.

  

    **(b) $\implies$ (e') For every subset $A \subseteq X$, $\overline{A} = \bigcap \{F \subseteq X : F \text{ is closed and } A \subseteq F \}$. This is the definition of closure, so it's always true.

  

    The intended statement for (e) might be related to the interior.

  

    Let's assume there was a typo in (e) and move on.

 **Let $X$ be uncountable. Show that $(X, \mathcal{T}_{co-countable})$ is not first countable.**

  

    Suppose $(X, \mathcal{T}_{co-countable})$ is first countable. Then for each $x \in X$, there exists a countable local basis $\{B_n(x)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ at $x$. Consider a specific point $p \in X$. Let $\{B_n(p)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a countable local basis at $p$. Each $B_n(p)$ is open in the co-countable topology, so $X \setminus B_n(p)$ is countable.

    Consider the set $Y = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (X \setminus B_n(p))$. Since it is a countable union of countable sets, $Y$ is countable. Since $X$ is uncountable, $X \setminus Y$ is uncountable.

    Let $q \in X \setminus Y$ such that $q \neq p$. Since $q \notin Y$, $q \notin X \setminus B_n(p)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, which means $q \in B_n(p)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

    Since $X$ is T1 (as the complement of a singleton is co-countable, hence open), $\{q\}$ is closed, so $X \setminus \{q\}$ is open and contains $p$. Since $\{B_n(p)\}$ is a local basis at $p$, there exists some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $B_m(p) \subseteq X \setminus \{q\}$, which means $q \notin B_m(p)$. This contradicts the fact that $q \in B_n(p)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

    Therefore, $(X, \mathcal{T}_{co-countable})$ is not first countable.

  
# 5.

  **Let $X$ be a finite set. Show that the only T1 topology on $X$ is the discrete topology.**

  

    Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a T1 topology on a finite set $X$. Since $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is T1, for every $x \in X$, the singleton set $\{x\}$ is closed (by problem 3). The complement of a closed set is open, so $X \setminus \{x\}$ is open for every $x \in X$.

    Now consider any subset $A \subseteq X$. We can write $A = \bigcup_{x \in A} \{x\}$. The complement of $A$ is $X \setminus A = X \setminus \bigcup_{x \in A} \{x\} = \bigcap_{x \in A} (X \setminus \{x\})$. Since each $X \setminus \{x\}$ is open, and $A$ is finite, $X \setminus A$ is a finite intersection of open sets, hence open. Therefore, $A$ is closed.

    Since every subset of $X$ is both open (because its complement is closed) and closed, the topology $\mathcal{T}$ must be the discrete topology $\mathcal{P}(X)$.

  **Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ be two distinct topologies on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$. If $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is Hausdorff, does that imply that $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ is Hausdorff? What about the other direction?**

  

    **Case 1: $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is Hausdorff $\implies$ $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ is Hausdorff?**

    Yes. Let $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Since $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint $\mathcal{T}_1$-open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. Since $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$, $U$ and $V$ are also $\mathcal{T}_2$-open sets. They are still disjoint and contain $x$ and $y$ respectively. Therefore, $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ is Hausdorff.

  

    **Case 2: $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ is Hausdorff $\implies$ $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is Hausdorff?**

    No. Consider $X = \mathbb{R}$. Let $\mathcal{T}_2$ be the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$, which is Hausdorff. Let $\mathcal{T}_1$ be the co-finite topology on $\mathbb{R}$. We know that $\mathcal{T}_1 \subsetneq \mathcal{T}_2$. However, $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is not Hausdorff. To see this, consider any two nonempty open sets $U, V$ in the co-finite topology. Their complements $\mathbb{R} \setminus U$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus V$ are finite. Then $\mathbb{R} \setminus (U \cap V) = (\mathbb{R} \setminus U) \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus V)$, which is a finite union of finite sets, hence finite. Therefore, $U \cap V$ cannot be empty (unless $\mathbb{R}$ is finite, which it is not). Thus, there exist two distinct points in $\mathbb{R}$ that cannot be separated by disjoint co-finite open sets.

  
# 7.

 **Show that every second countable topological space is both separable and first countable.**

  

   **Second countable $\implies$ first countable:** Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a second countable space, so it has a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$. For any $x \in X$, consider the subfamily of $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of all basis elements that contain $x$: $\mathcal{B}_x = \{ B \in \mathcal{B} : x \in B \}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is countable, $\mathcal{B}_x$ is also countable. We claim that $\mathcal{B}_x$ is a local basis at $x$. Let $U$ be any open set containing $x$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$, $U$ can be written as a union of elements from $\mathcal{B}$. Since $x \in U$, there must exist some $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$. This $B$ is in $\mathcal{B}_x$, and we have found a basis element in $\mathcal{B}_x$ contained in $U$. Therefore, $\mathcal{B}_x$ is a countable local basis at $x$, and $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is first countable.

  

   **Second countable $\implies$ separable:** Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a second countable space with a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$. For each nonempty basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$, choose one point $x_B \in B$. Let $D = \{ x_B : B \in \mathcal{B}, B \neq \emptyset \}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is countable, $D$ is also countable. We claim that $D$ is dense in $X$, i.e., $\overline{D} = X$. Let $y$ be any point in $X$, and let $W$ be any nonempty open set containing $y$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$, there exists a basis element $B' \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $y \in B' \subseteq W$. Since $B'$ is a nonempty basis element, we chose a point $x_{B'} \in D$ such that $x_{B'} \in B' \subseteq W$. Thus, $W \cap D \neq \emptyset$. Since this holds for any nonempty open set $W$ containing $y$, $y$ is in the closure of $D$. Since this is true for all $y \in X$, we have $\overline{D} = X$, so $D$ is a countable dense subset of $X$. Therefore, $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is separable.


# 8.

Which of the spaces have seen so far in the course are first countable? Which are Hausdorff? This is an exercise you should make a point of doing whenever we define new properties of topological spaces. Essentially, you should be mentally constructing a table like the following one, and filling in “yes” or “no” whenever we learn something new. Most of these have been resolved by examples in the notes or earlier problems, so there isn’t much to think about in most cases.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a $G_\delta$ set if it equals a countable intersection of open subsets of $X$. In other words, $A \subseteq X$ is a $G_\delta$ set if there exist open sets $U_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, such that $A = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$. Show that in a first countable T1 space, $\{x\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set for every $x \in X$.

   Construct a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ which is countable (i.e., $X$ is countable) but not first countable.
   
   (Note, no topological space we have seen so far does this. You really have to construct a new space from scratch. Feel free to do some research on the subject, but not before you spend some time thinking about it.)
