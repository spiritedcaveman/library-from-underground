  The purpose of this exercise is to work on your intuition about $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{unif}$. Recall that the uniform    metric $d_u$ on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ is defined by
$$d_u(x, y) = \sup \{ d(x_n, y_n) : n \in \mathbb{N} \}.$$
   Fix $x \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon > 0$, and define a subset:
    $$U(x, \epsilon) = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (x_n - \epsilon, x_n + \epsilon) = (x_1 - \epsilon, x_1 + \epsilon) \times (x_2 - \epsilon, x_2 + \epsilon) \times (x_3 - \epsilon, x_3 + \epsilon) \times \cdots$$
    (a) Show that $U(x, \epsilon) \neq B_\epsilon(x)$ (where $B_\epsilon(x)$ is the $\epsilon$-ball around $x$ according to $d_u$).
    (b) Show that $U(x, \epsilon)$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{unif}$.
    (c) Show that for $\epsilon \le 1$,
    $$B_\epsilon(x) = \bigcup_{0 < \delta < \epsilon} U(x, \delta).$$

 For each of the following functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$, determine whether they are continuous or open  when $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ has the box, uniform, and product topologies.

# 4.

 Recall that we say two sets $A$ and $B$ are of the same cardinality if there exists a bijection $f : A \to B$. In this case, we write $|A| = |B|$.

   Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. Show that if $|I| = |J|$, then $X^I$ is homeomorphic to $X^J$ (where both sets have the product topology). Also show with an example that the converse is not true.

 Let $R_0 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ be the collection of all sequences that are eventually constantly zero. Compute the closure of $R_0$ in the box, uniform, and product topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$.

  
# 6.

 A sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots) \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ is called square summable if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n^2$ converges. The collection of all square summable sequences in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ is called $\ell^2$. The function
 
                            $d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^\infty (x_n - y_n)^2}$ 
 
 defines a metric on $\ell^2$, which defines a topology $\mathcal{T}_{\ell^2}$. Let $\mathcal{T}_{box}, \mathcal{T}_{unif}, \mathcal{T}_{prod}$ be the subspace topologies $\ell^2$ inherits from the box, uniform, and product topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$, respectively.

  (a) Show that $\mathcal{T}_{unif} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\ell^2} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{box}$.

  (b) Show that $R_0 \subseteq \ell^2$. Show that the four topologies $R_0$ inherits from the four topologies on $\ell^2$ we are considering are all distinct.

  (c) Let $H \subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ be defined by 
    
                              $H = \prod_{n=1}^\infty [0, \frac{1}{n}]$
  
 $H$ is called the Hilbert cube. Show that $H \subseteq \ell^2$. Determine which of the topologies $H$ inherits from $\ell^2$ coincide.

# 8.

 Let $I$ be a nonempty indexing set and let $\{(X_\alpha, \mathcal{T}_\alpha) : \alpha \in I\}$ be a collection of nonempty topological spaces. Suppose $X = \prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ (with the product topology) is Hausdorff. Show that $(X_\alpha, \mathcal{T}_\alpha)$ is Hausdorff for each $\alpha \in I$.
  Hint: First, show that each Xα is homeomorphic to a subspace of X in a natural way

Show that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}_{prod}$ is separable.
 Hint: Consider the collection of all step functions with finitely many steps, rational step heights,   and whose steps are all on rational intervals
   
# 10.

  The previous exercise along with the second last one in this section say that uncountable     products of separable spaces can be separable. This may strike you as odd, and that’s fine; we are getting cloe to Continuum Hypothesis territory here. What might make you feel a little better is the result of this exercise.
 
  Let $I$ be an uncountable indexing set, and let $\mathcal{X} = \{ (X_\alpha, \mathcal{T}_\alpha) : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of topological spaces, each of which is T1 and contains two or more points. Let $X = \prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ be their product (with its product topology). Define a subset $A \subseteq X$ by:

$$A := \{ g \in X : g(\alpha) = f(\alpha) \text{ for all but countably many } \alpha \in I \} .$$

 Let $D = \{g_1, g_2, g_3, \dots \} \subseteq A$ be any countable set.

 (a) Show that there exists an $\alpha \in I$ such that $g_n(\alpha) = f(\alpha)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

 (b) Find an open subset $U \subseteq X$ such that $g_n \notin U \cap A$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

 (c) Conclude that $D$ is not dense, and therefore $A$ is not separable.
 
 
# 11.

 This is a very important exercise, in which we are going to define a topology on the power set of an arbitrary set X. The last two parts, which are probably the most interesting parts, are going to be somewhat mind-bending. They are not difficult proofs, just tricky ones to get your head around.
 
 Let $X$ be an infinite set. Recall that there is a natural bijection between $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and $\{0, 1\}^X$, via indicator functions. For a subset $A \subseteq X$, define its indicator function $i_A : X \to \{0, 1\}$ by $i_A(x) = 1$ if and only if $x \in A$.

  

(a) Show that the mapping $\phi : \mathcal{P}(X) \to \{0, 1\}^X$ defined by $A \mapsto i_A$ is a bijection.

  

(b) Say that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ is open if and only if $\phi(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \{0, 1\}^X$ is open (where $\{0, 1\}^X$ has the product topology induced by the discrete topology on all of the factors). Call this topology $\mathcal{T}$.

Write down a natural-feeling basis for $\mathcal{T}$.

  

(c) Describe what it means for a sequence $\{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to converge to a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ in this topology.

  

(d) Proposition 14.1. Let $\mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ be a filter. Then $\mathcal{U}$ is an ultrafilter if and only if for every $A \subseteq X$, either $A \in \mathcal{U}$ or $X \setminus A \in \mathcal{U}$.

  

Definition 14.2. An ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $X$ is called principal, if there is an element $a \in X$ such that $\mathcal{U} = \{ A \subseteq X : a \in A \}$. An ultrafilter that is not a principal ultrafilter is called non-principal.

  

(e) Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a principal ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$. Determine whether $\mathcal{U}$, as a subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ with the topology $\mathcal{T}$, is open, closed or neither.

  

(f) Do the same but for a non-principal ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$.


# 12.

The earlier exercise about determining whether or not certain sequences converge in the box topology probably led you to believe that it’s very hard for a sequence to converge in the box topology. Obviously constant sequences converge, and sequences that basically “live in” $\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$ converge, such as the following sequence:

$y_1 = (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, \dots)$

$y_2 = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0, 0, 0, \dots)$

$y_3 = (\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0, 0, 0, \dots)$

$y_4 = (\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, 0, 0, 0, \dots)$


(a) Let $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ with the property that every $x_n$ has infinitely many nonzero    terms. Show that $\{x_n\}$ does not converge to $0 = (0, 0, 0, \dots)$ in the box topology.
 Hint: Diagonalize!
  

(b) Find a stronger condition than the one in part (a) that guarantees a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{box}$ does not converge to $0$. Make sure your condition applies to $e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots$ from the previous exercise.

# 13.

This and the next exercise are difficult because they are notationally intensive, but they are not    very difficult proofs. I will guide you through most of the work.
 In this first exercise, you are going to generalize the fact that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$ is separable. Instead of showing that a product of copies of $\mathbb{R}$ indexed by $\mathbb{R}$ is separable, you will show that any product of  separable spaces indexed by $\mathbb{R}$ is separable.
 
Let $\mathcal{X} = \{ (X_\alpha, \mathcal{T}_\alpha) : \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \}$ be a collection of separable topological spaces. Let $X := \prod_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}} X_\alpha$ with its product topology. For each $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, fix a countable dense subset $D_\alpha \subseteq X_\alpha$, and fix an enumeration $D_\alpha = \{x^\alpha_1, x^\alpha_2, x^\alpha_3, \dots \}$. Let $\mathcal{B} = \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ be the usual countable basis for the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite set of mutually disjoint intervals with rational endpoints, and let $f : \mathcal{F} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a function. Let $E$ be the set of all such pairs $(\mathcal{F}, f)$.

(a) Show that the set $E$ is countable.

(b) For each pair $(\mathcal{F}, f)$, define an element $g \in X$ by:
$$g_{\mathcal{F},f}(\alpha) = \begin{cases} x^\alpha_{f(B)} & \alpha \in B \text{ for some } B \in \mathcal{F} \\ x^\alpha_1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
Convince yourself that this is a well-defined element of $X$.

(c) Show that the set $D := \{ g_{\mathcal{F},f} : (\mathcal{F}, f) \in E \}$ is a countable dense subset of $X$.

# 14.

 Let $\mathcal{X} = \{ (X_\alpha, \mathcal{T}_\alpha) : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of separable Hausdorff topological spaces, each with two or more points. Let $X := \prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$. For each $\alpha \in I$, let $U^\alpha_0$ and $U^\alpha_1$ be disjoint, nonempty open subsets of $X_\alpha$. Let $D \subseteq X$ be a countable dense set. For each $\alpha \in I$, let:
$$D_\alpha := \pi_\alpha^{-1}(U^\alpha_0) \cap D = \{ f \in X : f(\alpha) \in U^\alpha_0 \} \cap D.$$

 (a) Show that $D_\alpha \neq \emptyset$ for each $\alpha \in I$.

 (b) Show that if $\alpha \neq \beta$, then $D_\alpha \neq D_\beta$.

 (c) By the previous two parts, the map $I \to \mathcal{P}(D)$ defined by $\alpha \mapsto D_\alpha$ is an injection. Recalling that $|\mathbb{R}| = |\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})|$, convince yourself that $|I| \le |\mathbb{R}|$.
