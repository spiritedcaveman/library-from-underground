# 7.
In an arbitrary topological space, is the union of two dense sets necessarily dense? What about the intersection of two dense sets? For both questions, prove it or give a counterexample.

    For some of the exercises in this section, we are going to need a new definition. This definition is dual to the definition of closure in some sense, though it will not be quite as useful for us.

    Definition 3.1. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. We define the interior of $A$ in $(X, \mathcal{T})$, denoted $\operatorname{int}(A)$, by:
    $$x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \text{ if and only if there is an open set } U \text{ containing } x \text{ such that } U \subseteq A.$$
# 8.
Show for any topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and any $A \subseteq X$, that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open.

  

   Let $y \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. By the definition of the interior, there exists an open set $V$ such that $y \in V$ and $V \subseteq A$. We want to show that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open, which means that for every point $y$ in $\operatorname{int}(A)$, there exists an open set $W$ containing $y$ such that $W \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   Consider the open set $V$ that contains $y$ and is a subset of $A$. We claim that $V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$. Let $z \in V$. Since $V$ is open and $z \in V$, $V$ is an open set containing $z$. Furthermore, we know that $V \subseteq A$. Therefore, by the definition of the interior, $z \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. Since this holds for any $z \in V$, we conclude that $V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   Thus, for every $y \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, we have found an open set $V$ (containing $y$) such that $V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$. This shows that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open.

  

# 9.
Going further than the previous exercise, show that

    $$\operatorname{int}(A) = \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \} .$$

   Many texts will take the equation above as the definition of the interior of a set.

  

   Let $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. By definition, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x \in U$ and $U \subseteq A$. This open set $U$ is one of the sets in the union on the right-hand side. Therefore, $x$ is an element of the union. This shows that $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \}$.

  

   Conversely, let $x \in \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \}$. Then there exists at least one open set $V$ such that $x \in V$ and $V \subseteq A$. By the definition of the interior, this means that $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. This shows that $\bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \} \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.
    
Combining both inclusions, we have int(A)=⋃{U⊆X:U is open, and U⊆A}. 

# 10.
Show that a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $A$ is open. For every $x \in A$, $A$ itself is an open set containing $x$ such that $A \subseteq A$. By the definition of the interior, $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. Therefore, $A \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

   From the definition of the interior, $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is a union of open sets contained in $A$, so $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$.

   Thus, if $A$ is open, then $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$. From Exercise 8, we know that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open. Since $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, it follows that $A$ is open.

  

   Therefore, a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$.

        $\operatorname{int}((0, 1]) = (0, 1]$, $\overline{(0, 1]} = (0, 1]$.

   (e) $(0, 1]$ in $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_{ray})$.

        $\operatorname{int}((0, 1]) = (0, 1)$, $\overline{(0, 1]} = (-\infty, 1]$.

   (k) $\{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x = 0 \}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3_{usual}$.

        $\operatorname{int}(\{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x = 0 \}) = \emptyset$, $\overline{\{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x = 0 \}} = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x = 0 \}$.

  

Another new definition, intimately connected to interiors and closures.

Definition 3.2. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and let $A \subseteq X$. We define the boundary of $A$ in $(X, \mathcal{T})$, denoted $\partial(A)$, by

$$x \in \partial(A) \text{ if and only if for every open set } U \text{ containing } x, U \cap A \neq \emptyset \text{ and } U \cap (X \setminus A) \neq \emptyset.$$

Intuitively, these are the points that are close to both $A$ and its complement.

# 12.
Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Show that $\partial(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A} = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

# 13.
Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Show that $\overline{A} = A \cup \partial(A)$ and $\operatorname{int}(A) = A \setminus \partial(A)$.

  

# 14.
Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Show that $X = \operatorname{int}(A) \sqcup \partial(A) \sqcup \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$. (The $\sqcup$ is the “disjoint union” symbol.)

  

# 15.
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is called regular open if $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = A$.

   (a) Show that in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$, any open interval $(a, b)$ is regular open.

   (b) Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Is it true that $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \operatorname{int}(A)$? If not, is there containment one way or the other?

   (c) Show that the intersection of two regular open sets is again regular open (in any topological space).

   (d) Is the union of two regular open sets again regular open? Prove it or give a counterexample.

   (e) Given a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, let $A^c = X \setminus A$. Show that a set $A$ is regular open if and only if $(A^c)^c = A$, where the interior is taken after the complement.

  

# 16.
Let $A$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its usual topology. Show that $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if there exists a sequence of elements of $A$ that converges to $x$.

  

# 17.
We have already learned that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology. Is $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ dense? How about if you remove finitely many points from $\mathbb{Q}$? Is there an infinite set of points you can remove from $\mathbb{Q}$ that leaves the resulting set dense?

  

# 18.
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be dense open subsets of $X$. Prove that $D_1 \cap D_2$ is dense and open. Give an example in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ to show that this does not extend even to countably infinite intersections.

  

# 19.
Recall the Furstenberg topology $\mathcal{T}_{Furst}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$.

   (a) Show that $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{-1, 1\} = \bigcup_{p \text{ is prime}} \mathbb{Z}(p, 0)$.

   (b) Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many primes. Deduce from this assumption that $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{-1, 1\}$ is closed.
   
   (c) Find a contradiction resulting from the previous part, and conclude that there must be infinitely many primes.

  

# 20.
Prove that if $\{ D_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is a collection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$, then $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty D_n$ is dense. Give an example in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ to show that this result does not extend to arbitrary (i.e., uncountable) intersections.

  

# 21.
This is a famous problem called the Kuratowski 14-set problem.

   Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. Prove that at most 14 distinct sets can be obtained by successively applying the operations of closures and complements to $A$ any (finite) number of times. Give an example of a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology such that 14 different sets can be obtained in this way.
