 Let $X$ be a set and let . Show that the only topology on $X$ that contains $\mathcal{B} = \{ \{x\} : x \in X \}$ as a subset is the discrete topology.

 Proof.
by the hypothesis if a topology has $\mathcal{B} = \{ \{x\} : x \in X \}$, it will contain every subset of $X$ by just taking arbitrary unions of the open set and (as $\{x\}$ is there all the other ones are bound to be included)
so if any topology has $\mathcal{B}$ it will be discrete indeed
# 3.
Fix a set $X$, and let $\mathcal{T}_{co-finite}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{co-countable}$ be the co-finite and co-countable topologies on $X$, respectively.
(a) Show explicitly that $\mathcal{T}_{co-finite}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{co-countable}$ are both topologies on $X$.
Proof, so $X \setminus U$ is finite, take arbitrary unions of of those U's and the complement will be finite, same for arbitrary intersection(here the complement gets bigger actually but only finite times so we are safe)

(b) Show that $\mathcal{T}_{co-finite} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{co-countable}$.
Proof. same argument as above

(c) Under what circumstances does $\mathcal{T}_{co-finite} = \mathcal{T}_{co-countable}$?
 $X$ is finite or countable
 
(d) Under what circumstances does $\mathcal{T}_{co-countable} = \mathcal{T}_{discrete}$?
 $X$ is finite

  Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_{co-countable})$ be an infinite set with the co-countable topology. Show that $\mathcal{T}_{co-countable}$ is closed under countable intersections. Give an example to show that it need not be closed under arbitrary intersections.
  
   Proof. 
$$\mathcal{T}_{\text{co-countable}} = \{ U \subseteq X \mid U = \emptyset \text{ or } X \setminus U \text{ is countable} \}.$$
Closure under countable intersections:
Let $\{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a countable collection of open sets in $\mathcal{T}_{\text{co-countable}}$. Then for each $n$, either $U_n = \emptyset$ or $X \setminus U_n$ is countable.
If some $U_n = \emptyset$, then $\bigcap_n U_n = \emptyset \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{co-countable}}$.
Otherwise, for all $n$, $X \setminus U_n$ is countable. Then
$$X \setminus \bigcap_{n} U_n = \bigcup_{n} (X \setminus U_n),$$
which is a countable union of countable sets, hence countable. So $\bigcap_n U_n$ is open.


Counter Example: Let $X = \mathbb{R}$, and $U_r = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{r\}$ for each $r \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
$$\bigcap_{r \in \mathbb{R}} U_r = \emptyset \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{co-countable}}.$$But define $U_q = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{q\}$ for $q \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then$$\bigcap_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} U_q = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q},$$
which is the irrationals, whose complement is countable $\Rightarrow$ open.
Now take $U_r = \mathbb{R} \setminus C_r$ where $C_r = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \leq r\}$ for $r \in \mathbb{R}$ (uncountable family). Then $C_r$ is uncountable $\Rightarrow$ $U_r$ is not open. But suppose each $C_\alpha$ is countable, and $\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} C_\alpha$ is uncountable: then $\bigcap_\alpha (X \setminus C_\alpha)$ is not open.
Hence $\mathcal{T}_{\text{co-countable}}$ is not closed under arbitrary intersections.

Let $X$ be a nonempty set, and fix an element $p \in X$. Recall that    $$\mathcal{T}_p := \{U \subseteq X : p \in U \} \cup \{\emptyset\}.$$is called the particular point topology at $p$ on $X$. Show explicitly that $\mathcal{T}_p$ is a topology on $X$.

Proof. 
 trivial since by intersection and union p is not getting excluded
# 6. 
Recall that the ray topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is:    $$\mathcal{T}_{ray} := \{ (a, \infty) : a \in \mathbb{R} \} \cup \{\emptyset, \mathbb{R}\}.$$
Show explicitly that $\mathcal{T}_{ray}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Be sure to think carefully about unions.

Proof.
 $\bigcup_{i \in I} (a_i, \infty) = (a, \infty)$ for $a = \text{inf} a_i$, which is again in $\mathcal{T}_{ray}$.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$ be a set with the property that for every $x \in A$, there is an open set $U_x \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in U_x \subseteq A$. Show that $A$ is open.

Proof.
Let $A \subseteq X$ satisfy the property:
for every $x \in A$, there exists an open set $U_x \in \mathcal{T}$ such that
$$x \in U_x \subseteq A.$$Then, consider the union$$\bigcup_{x \in A} U_x.$$Since each $U_x$ is open, their union is open:$$\bigcup_{x \in A} U_x \in \mathcal{T}.$$Moreover, by construction, every $x \in A$ lies in some $U_x \subseteq A$, so$$A \subseteq \bigcup_{x \in A} U_x \subseteq A,$$hence equality:$$A = \bigcup_{x \in A} U_x,$$
so $A$ is open.
# 8.
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $f : X \to Y$ be an injective (but not necessarily surjective) function. Is $\mathcal{T}_f := \{ f(U) : U \in \mathcal{T} \}$ necessarily a topology on $Y$? Is it necessarily a topology on the range of $f$?

Proof.
 On $(Y)$: $\mathcal{T}_f$ is not necessarily a topology on $Y$. Consider $X = \{a, b, c\}$ with the indiscrete topology $\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X\}$, and let $Y = \{a, b, c, d\}$ with $f : X \to Y$ defined by $f(a) = a$, $f(b) = b$, $f(c) = c$. Then $f$ is injective, and $\mathcal{T}_f = \{ f(\emptyset), f(X) \} = \{ \emptyset, \{a, b, c\} \}$. For $\mathcal{T}_f$ to be a topology on $Y$, it must contain $Y = \{a, b, c, d\}$, but $\{a, b, c\} \neq Y$ and no $U \in \mathcal{T}$ maps to $Y$ since $f$ is not surjective. Thus, $\mathcal{T}_f$ is not a topology on $Y$, as it violates the axiom requiring the whole space to be open.
 
 On the range $f(X)$: $\mathcal{T}_f$ is a topology on $f(X)$. The range of $f$ is $f(X) = \{ f(x) : x \in X \}$. Since $f$ is injective, for each $U \in \mathcal{T}$, $f(U) \subseteq f(X)$. Verify the topology axioms on $f(X)$:
    $\circ$ **Empty set:** $\emptyset = f(\emptyset) \in \mathcal{T}_f$, as $\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$.
    $\circ$ **Whole space:** $f(X) = f(X) \in \mathcal{T}_f$, as $X \in \mathcal{T}$.
    $\circ$ **Unions:** For a family $\{ V_i = f(U_i) : U_i \in \mathcal{T} \} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_f$, their union is $\bigcup V_i = \bigcup f(U_i) = f\left( \bigcup U_i \right)$. Since $\bigcup U_i \in \mathcal{T}$, $f\left( \bigcup U_i \right) \in \mathcal{T}_f$.
    $\circ$ **Finite intersections:** For $V_1 = f(U_1), V_2 = f(U_2) \in \mathcal{T}_f$, their intersection is $V_1 \cap V_2 = f(U_1) \cap f(U_2) = f(U_1 \cap U_2)$, since $f$ is injective. As $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \mathcal{T}$, $f(U_1 \cap U_2) \in \mathcal{T}_f$. This extends to finite intersections by induction.

Thus, $\mathcal{T}_f = \{ f(U) : U \in \mathcal{T} \}$ is a topology on $f(X)$.


*so $(X, \mathcal{T})$ just gets relabelled by $f$ in $X$ with elements in $Y$*
# 9.
Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ be two topologies on $X$. Is $\mathcal{T}_1 \cup \mathcal{T}_2$ a topology on $X$? What about $\mathcal{T}_1 \cap \mathcal{T}_2$? If yes, prove it. If not, give a counterexample.

 Proof.
 1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in every topology so they are in $\mathcal{T}$

2. Let $U=\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i$ be an arbitrary union of elements of the intersection $\mathcal{T}$. $U$ is open in every topology (because $A_i$ is in $\mathcal{T}$ for all $i\in I$) so it's open in $\mathcal{T}$

3. Let $V=A_1\cap\dots\cap A_n$ be a finite intersection of elements of the intersection. $V$ is open in every topology (because $A_i$ is in $\mathcal{T}$ for all $i\in[1,n]$) so it's open in $\mathcal{T}$

Moreover, $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{j}$ for every topology $\mathcal{T}_j$ in the intersected family so it's coarser than all of them.
# 10.
Let $X$ be an infinite set. Show that there are infinitely many distinct topologies on $X$.

**Proof:**
Let $x_0 \in X$ be fixed. For each natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define
$$\mathcal{T}_n := \{\emptyset, X, \{x_0\}, \{x_0, x_1\}, \dots, \{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}\}\},$$
where $\{x_1, x_2, \dots\} \subseteq X \setminus \{x_0\}$ are distinct elements.

Each $\mathcal{T}_n$ is a topology (finite, satisfies union/intersection rules), and for $m \ne n$, we have $\mathcal{T}_m \ne \mathcal{T}_n$ (since one contains a strictly larger open set than the other). Thus, the $\mathcal{T}_n$ are all distinct.

Hence, there are infinitely many distinct topologies on $X$.

# 11.
Fix a set $X$, and let $\phi$ be a property that subsets $A$ of $X$ can have. For example, $\phi$ could be “$A$ is countable”, or “$A$ is finite$”. $\phi$ could be “$A$ contains $p$” or “$A$ doesn’t contain $p$” for a fixed point $p \in X$. If $X = \mathbb{R}$, $\phi$ could be “$A$ is an interval” or “$A$ contains uncountably many irrational numbers less than $\pi$”. Define
 $$\mathcal{T}_{co-\phi} = \{U \subseteq X : U = \emptyset, \text{ or } X \setminus U \text{ has } \phi \} .$$
  Under what assumptions on $\phi$ is $\mathcal{T}_{co-\phi}$ a topology on $X$? Which topologies we have seen so far can be described in this way, using which $\phi$'s?

Proof.
 To ensure $\mathcal{T}_{\text{co-}\varphi}$ is a topology, the property $\varphi$ on subsets of $X$ must satisfy:

$\varnothing$ has $\varphi$ (ensures $X \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{co-}\varphi}$),
$\varphi$ is closed under arbitrary intersections (ensures $\mathcal{T}_{\text{co-}\varphi}$ is closed under arbitrary unions),
$\varphi$ is closed under finite unions (ensures $\mathcal{T}_{\text{co-}\varphi}$ is closed under finite intersections).

Let $\{ \mathcal{T}_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of topologies on a set $X$, where $I$ is some indexing set. Prove that there is a unique finest topology that is refined by all the $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$'s. That is, prove that there is a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ such that
 (a) $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ refines $\mathcal{T}$ for every $\alpha \in I$.
 (b) If $\mathcal{T}'$ is another topology that is refined by $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for every $\alpha \in I$, then $\mathcal{T}$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}'$.

Proof.
 Let $\mathscr{T} = \{\mathcal{T}_\alpha : \alpha \in A\}$ be a collection of topologies on a set $X$, and define $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{T}_\alpha$. Then $\mathcal{B}$ is a base for a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$, since the union of topologies always covers $X$ and is closed under intersections at points. The topology $\mathcal{T}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is thus a valid topology on $X$.
 
 By construction, each $\mathcal{T}_\alpha \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, since all basic open sets from each $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ are included in $\mathcal{B}$, and hence all their unions (i.e., the entire $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$) are open in $\mathcal{T}$. Moreover, if $\mathcal{T}'$ is any topology on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T}_\alpha \subseteq \mathcal{T}'$ for all $\alpha$, then $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}'$ as well, and since $\mathcal{T}$ is the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$, it follows that $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}'$. Hence, $\mathcal{T}$ is the smallest topology containing all of the topologies in $\mathscr{T}$ and is uniquely characterized by this minimality property.
 
 Now, consider $\mathcal{T} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in A} \mathcal{T}_\alpha$, the intersection of all topologies in $\mathscr{T}$. Since the intersection of topologies is always a topology, $\mathcal{T}$ is itself a topology on $X$, and clearly $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$. Finally, if $\mathcal{T}'$ is any topology such that $\mathcal{T}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, then $\mathcal{T}' \subseteq \bigcap \mathcal{T}_\alpha = \mathcal{T}$, proving that $\mathcal{T}$ is the largest topology contained in all the $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$. This intersection topology is also uniquely determined by its maximality property.
# 13.
This extends Exercise 8. Show with examples that the assumption that $f$ is injective is **NOT** necessary. That is, give an example of a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and a non-injective function $f : X \to Y$ such that $\mathcal{T}_f$ is a topology, and also give an example where $\mathcal{T}_f$ is not a topology. (Hint: You can do both in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$.)

Soln.
Let $X = \mathbb{R}$ with the discrete topology, and define $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$. Then $f$ is not injective. For any nonempty $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f(U) = {0}$, so $\mathcal{T}_f = {\emptyset, {0}}$, which is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\mathcal{T}_f$ can be a topology even when $f$ is not injective.

Now let $X = \mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, and define $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$. Then $f$ is not injective. For each open interval $(a, b)$, $f((a, b))$ is a finite or countable subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, so images of open sets under $f$ are sets like ${0, 1, 2}$ etc. But $\mathcal{T}_f$ is not closed under unions: for instance, $f((0,1)) = {0}$ and $f((1,2)) = {1}$, so $f((0,1)) \cup f((1,2)) = {0,1}$, but there is no open $U$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $f(U) = {0,1}$. Hence $\mathcal{T}_f$ is not a topology.

Working in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$:

(a) Show that every nonempty open set contains a rational number.


Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and open. Then by definition, for some $x \in U$, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \subseteq U$.

Now consider the interval $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon)$: it’s an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable but unbounded, so for any such interval, it must contain a rational number (this follows from the fact that between any two real numbers $a < b$, there exists $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < q < b$).


*Since the rationals Q are dense in R, every nonempty open set U⊆R contains an interval (a,b)⊆U. As Q∩(a,b)=∅, U contains a rational number.*

(b) Show that there is no uncountable collection of pairwise disjoint open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.
  
  Assume there is an uncountable collection $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of pairwise disjoint open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Each $U_\alpha$ contains a rational number (since rationals are dense), and rationals are countable. But each $U_\alpha$ contains a **unique** rational (because the $U_\alpha$ are disjoint). This implies $|A|$ is countable, contradicting uncountability.
