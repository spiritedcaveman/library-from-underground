  Construct an explicit bijection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ (i.e., give a formula for such a bijection).

   One such bijection is given by:

    $$f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n-1}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\ -\frac{n}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \end{cases}$$

   This maps $1 \mapsto 0, 2 \mapsto -1, 3 \mapsto 1, 4 \mapsto -2, 5 \mapsto 2$, and so on, covering all integers exactly once.

  Prove Proposition 4.11 from the lecture notes on Countability.

   Proposition 4.11 states: Let $A$ be a set. The following are equivalent:

   (a) $A$ is countable.

   (b) There exists an injection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$.

   (c) There exists a surjection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$ (if $A \neq \emptyset$).

  

    (a) $\implies$ (b): If $A$ is countable, then $A$ is either finite or countably infinite. If $A$ is finite, there exists a bijection $f: A \to \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, which is also an injection into $\mathbb{N}$. If $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$, which is also an injection into $\mathbb{N}$.

  

    (b) $\implies$ (a): If there exists an injection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$, then $f$ is a bijection from $A$ to its image $f(A) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Since $f(A)$ is a subset of a countable set, $f(A)$ is countable. Since $A$ is in bijection with a countable set, $A$ is countable.

  

    (a) $\implies$ (c) (if $A \neq \emptyset$): If $A$ is countable, then $A$ is either finite or countably infinite. If $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$, which is also a surjection. If $A$ is finite and nonempty, say $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, we can define a surjection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$ by $g(i) = a_i$ for $1 \le i \le n$, and $g(i) = a_1$ for $i > n$. This step involves making a choice for the elements of $A$.

  

    (c) $\implies$ (a): If there exists a surjection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$, we can construct an injection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$ as follows. For each $a \in A$, the set $g^{-1}(\{a\}) = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : g(n) = a\}$ is nonempty. We can choose the smallest element $n_a$ from each $g^{-1}(\{a\})$ and define $f(a) = n_a$. If $f(a) = f(b)$, then $n_a = n_b$, which implies $a = g(n_a) = g(n_b) = b$, so $f$ is injective. Since there exists an injection from $A$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $A$ is countable by part (b). This step uses the Axiom of Choice because we are making a choice from each of the (possibly infinitely many) nonempty sets $g^{-1}(\{a\})$.

  Let $A$ be a countable set. Prove that $\text{Fin}(A) := \{ X \subseteq A : X \text{ is finite } \}$ is countable.

    If $A$ is finite, then $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is finite, and $\text{Fin}(A) = \mathcal{P}(A)$, so $\text{Fin}(A)$ is countable.

    If $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijection $h: \mathbb{N} \to A$. A finite subset $X \subseteq A$ can be mapped to a finite subset $h^{-1}(X) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable. We can enumerate the finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ by first listing subsets of size 0, then size 1, then size 2, and so on. For each size $k$, we can order the subsets lexicographically. Since there is a bijection between $\text{Fin}(A)$ and the set of finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, $\text{Fin}(A)$ is countable.

  

# 4.

  Let $A$ and $B$ be countable sets. Prove that $A \times B$ is countable. Then show that the Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable.

    If $A$ and $B$ are countable, then there exist surjections $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$ and $g: \mathbb{N} \to B$. We can define a surjection $h: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to A \times B$ by $h(m, n) = (f(m), g(n))$. Since $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable (there exists a bijection with $\mathbb{N}$), and there is a surjection from a countable set to $A \times B$, $A \times B$ is countable.

    By induction, the Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable. The base case ($n=1$) is trivial. Assume that the Cartesian product of $k$ countable sets is countable. Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_{k+1}$ be countable sets. Then $(A_1 \times \dots \times A_k) \times A_{k+1}$ is the Cartesian product of two countable sets, which we have shown is countable. Thus, the Cartesian product of $k+1$ countable sets is countable.

Complete the proof of Corollary 5.5 in the lecture notes on Countability. That is, if $A_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are all countably infinite, mutually disjoint sets and $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to A_n$ witnesses that $A_n$ is countable, prove that $g : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$ defined by $g(n, i) = f_n(i)$ is a bijection. Conclude from this that a countable union of countable sets is countable.

    Since the sets $A_n$ are mutually disjoint, if $g(n, i) = g(m, j)$, then $f_n(i) = f_m(j)$ implies that the element is in $A_n \cap A_m$. Since the sets are disjoint, this can only happen if $n = m$. If $n = m$, then $f_n(i) = f_n(j)$. Since $f_n$ is a bijection, $i = j$. Thus, $g$ is injective.

    For any element $y \in \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$, there exists some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $y \in A_n$. Since $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to A_n$ is a surjection, there exists $i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f_n(i) = y$. Then $g(n, i) = f_n(i) = y$, so $g$ is surjective.

    Since $g$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ to $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$, and $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable, a countable union of countably infinite sets is countable. The case of a countable union of finite sets is similar (or can be embedded into this argument by considering finite sets as subsets of $\mathbb{N}$). Thus, a countable union of countable sets is countable.

    Show that $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}} = \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ is countable, and conclude that $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ is second countable.

    The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is countable. The set of pairs of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ is also countable. There is a bijection between the set of open intervals with rational endpoints and $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ (mapping $(a, b)$ to $(a, b)$). Therefore, $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is countable.

    The usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable basis $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$. A topological space is second countable if it has a countable basis. Therefore, $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ is second countable.

  Prove the uncountable pigeonhole principle. That is, if $A$ is an uncountable set and $A_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are mutually disjoint subsets of $A$ such that $A = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$, show that at least one of the $A_n$ must be uncountable.

    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that every $A_n$ is countable for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $A$ is a countable union of countable sets. By Corollary 5.5 (proven in question 5), a countable union of countable sets is countable. Therefore, $A$ must be countable. This contradicts the given information that $A$ is uncountable. Thus, our initial assumption that every $A_n$ is countable must be false. Therefore, at least one of the $A_n$ must be uncountable.

Show that $\mathcal{B} = \{ B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n : x \in \mathbb{Q}^n \text{ and } 0 < \epsilon \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ is countable, and conclude that $\mathbb{R}^n_{usual}$ is second countable.

    The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is countable, so $\mathbb{Q}^n = \mathbb{Q} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Q}$ ($n$ times) is also countable. The set of positive rational numbers $\{ \epsilon \in \mathbb{Q} : \epsilon > 0 \}$ is also countable. The basis $\mathcal{B}$ consists of open balls centered at a point with rational coordinates and having a rational radius. This is a subset of $\mathbb{Q}^n \times \{ \epsilon \in \mathbb{Q} : \epsilon > 0 \}$, which is a countable set. Thus, $\mathcal{B}$ is countable.

    The usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is generated by the basis of all open balls $B_\epsilon(y)$ where $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\epsilon > 0$. For any open set $U$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and any point $z \in U$, there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that $B_\delta(z) \subseteq U$. We can find a point $x \in \mathbb{Q}^n$ such that the distance between $x$ and $z$ is less than $\delta/2$, and a rational number $0 < \epsilon < \delta/2$. Then $z \in B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq B_\delta(z) \subseteq U$. Thus, every open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be written as a union of elements from the countable basis $\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{R}^n_{usual}$ is second countable.
# 10.

  In a previous exercise, you showed that the collection $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ of intervals $[a, b)$ with rational endpoints is not a basis for the Sorgenfrey line. Take this a step further by proving that there is no countable basis for the Sorgenfrey line. That is, prove that the Sorgenfrey line is not second countable.

    Suppose that the Sorgenfrey line $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{S})$ has a countable basis $\mathcal{B} = \{B_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. For each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $[x, x+1)$ is open in $\mathcal{S}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there must exist some $B_n \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B_n \subseteq [x, x+1)$. Since $B_n$ is a basis element, it must be of the form $[a, b)$ for some $a < b$. Thus, for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists $[a_x, b_x) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in [a_x, b_x) \subseteq [x, x+1)$, which implies $a_x \le x < b_x \le x+1$. In particular, $a_x \le x < b_x$. Since $a_x < b_x$, the interval $[a_x, b_x)$ is nonempty, so $b_x > a_x$. For each $x$, we can choose a rational number $q_x \in [x, b_x)$. This is possible because the rationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$. Consider the map $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathcal{B} \times \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $f(x) = ([a_x, b_x), q_x)$. If $x \neq y$, suppose without loss of generality that $x < y$. If $[a_x, b_x) = [a_y, b_y)$, then we must have $q_x \neq q_y$ because $x \le q_x < b_x$ and $y \le q_y < b_y$, and if $q_x = q_y$, then $x \le q_x = q_y < b_x = b_y$, and $y \le q_y = q_x < b_y = b_x$, which does not lead to a direct contradiction yet.

  

    Consider the collection of open intervals $\{[x, x+1) : x \in \mathbb{R}\}$. These are all open in the Sorgenfrey line. If there were a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$, then each $[x, x+1)$ would be a union of elements from $\mathcal{B}$. For each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there must be at least one basis element $[a, b) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in [a, b) \subseteq [x, x+1)$, so $a \le x < b \le x+1$. For each $x$, we can pick a rational number $q_x \in [x, b)$. If $x \neq y$, then the intervals $[x, x+1)$ and $[y, y+1)$ might overlap.

  

    Let's consider the uncountable set of open intervals $\{[x, x+1) : x \in \mathbb{R}\}$. If there is a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$, then each $[x, x+1)$ is a union of elements of $\mathcal{B}$. For each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, pick a basis element $B_x = [a_x, b_x) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in [a_x, b_x) \subseteq [x, x+1)$. Then $a_x \le x < b_x \le x+1$. For each $x$, we can choose a rational number $q_x \in [x, b_x)$. Consider the map $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathcal{B} \times \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $g(x) = (B_x, q_x)$. If $x \neq y$, can $g(x) = g(y)$? If $B_x = B_y = [a, b)$ and $q_x = q_y = q$, then $a \le x \le q < b$ and $

   Suppose $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is countable. Show that there exists a real number $x$ such that $A \cap (x + A) = \emptyset$. (Here, $x + A = \{ x + a : a \in A \}$.)

  

    Since $A$ is countable, the set $A - A = \{ a - b : a, b \in A \}$ is also countable. If $A \cap (x + A) \neq \emptyset$, then there exist $a, b \in A$ such that $a = x + b$, which implies $x = a - b \in A - A$. If for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $A \cap (x + A) \neq \emptyset$, then every real number $x$ would be in $A - A$. This would mean that $\mathbb{R} \subseteq A - A$. However, $A - A$ is countable, and $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. Therefore, there must exist some $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \notin A - A$, which implies $A \cap (x + A) = \emptyset$

Show that the set $2^\mathbb{N}$ of all functions $f : \mathbb{N} \to \{0, 1\}$ is uncountable. (Hint: Use the fact that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable.)

  

    There is a natural bijection between $2^\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. For a function $f : \mathbb{N} \to \{0, 1\}$, we can associate a subset $A_f = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : f(n) = 1 \} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Conversely, for a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we can define a function $f_A : \mathbb{N} \to \{0, 1\}$ by $f_A(n) = 1$ if $n \in A$, and $f_A(n) = 0$ if $n \notin A$. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between $2^\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. Since $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable (by Cantor's diagonal argument), $2^\mathbb{N}$ must also be uncountable.

 Let $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) be a fixed collection of functions. Construct a function $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$,

    $$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} = \infty$$

    (In words, construct a function $g$ that increases faster than all of the $f_n$'s.)

  

    Define $g(k) = \max \{ f_i(k) : 1 \le i \le k \} + k$. For any fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider $k > n$. Then $g(k) \ge f_n(k) + k > f_n(k)$. Therefore, $\frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} > 1 + \frac{k}{f_n(k)}$. As $k \to \infty$, $\frac{k}{f_n(k)} \ge 0$. If $f_n$ is bounded, then $\frac{k}{f_n(k)} \to \infty$. If $f_n$ is unbounded, $\frac{k}{f_n(k)}$ could tend to 0, but $g(k)$ will still be greater than $f_n(k)$ by at least $k$.

  

    A better construction: Define $g(k) = f_k(k) + 1$. For any fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider $k > n$. Then $g(k) = f_k(k) + 1$. We want to show that $\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{f_k(k) + 1}{f_n(k)} = \infty$. This construction doesn't necessarily work.

  

    Let's try $g(k) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^k f_i(k) \right) + 1$. Then for any fixed $n$, for $k \ge n$, $g(k) > f_n(k)$, but the limit of the ratio might not be infinite.

  

    Consider $g(k) = \prod_{i=1}^k (f_i(k) + 1)$. Then for any fixed $n$, for $k \ge n$, $\frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k (f_i(k) + 1)}{f_n(k)} = (f_n(k) + 1) \prod_{i \neq n, 1 \le i \le k} (f_i(k) + 1) / f_n(k) \ge f_n(k) + 1$. This also doesn't guarantee the limit is infinite.

  

    Let $g(k) = k \cdot \max \{ f_i(k) : 1 \le i \le k \} + 1$. For a fixed $n$, for $k \ge n$, $g(k) \ge k f_n(k) + 1$, so $\frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} \ge k + \frac{1}{f_n(k)}$. As $k \to \infty$, $\frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} \to \infty$.

 Let $f, g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be functions. Define the set $B(f, g) := \{ k \in \mathbb{N} : f(k) = g(k) \}$.

    Construct a family $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with the property that for any $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and any $N \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an $f_n$ in your family such that $|B(f_n, g)| > N$.

  

    Consider the family of constant functions $\{ f_n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $f_n(k) = n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be any function and $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Consider the values $g(1), g(2), \dots, g(N+1)$. By the pigeonhole principle, if these $N+1$ values take on at most $N$ distinct values, then at least two of them must be equal. This doesn't directly give $|B(f_n, g)| > N$.

  

    Consider the family of functions $\{ f_n^{(m)} : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \}_{n, m \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $f_n^{(m)}(k) = n$ for all $k \ge m$, and $f_n^{(m)}$ can be arbitrary for $k < m$. This family is countable.

  

    Let the family of functions be $\{ f_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $f_n(k) = (k \mod n) + 1$. Let $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be any function and $N \in \mathbb{N}$. For each $i \in \{1, \dots, N+1\}$, consider $g(i)$. There might be repetitions in the values of $g(i)$.

  

    Consider the family of functions $\{ f_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $f_n$ takes the value $n$ on an interval of length $n$, and then repeats. This seems complicated.

  

    Let the family of functions be all constant functions $f_n(k) = n$. Given $g$ and $N$, consider the values $g(1), \dots, g(N+1)$. If $g$ takes the same value $m$ at more than $N$ positions in the first $N+1$ integers, then $B(f_m, g)$ will have size greater than $N$. However, $g$ might take distinct values.

  

    Consider the family of functions $\{ f_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $f_n(k) = g(k)$ for $k \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ and $f_n(k) = 1$ for $k > n$. Then $|B(f_n, g)| \ge n$. So for any $N$, choose $n > N$.

Prove that $(0, 1)$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ have the same cardinality.

  

    We know that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ has the same cardinality as $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, the set of infinite binary sequences. For a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we can associate a binary sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ where $a_n = 1$ if $n \in A$ and $a_n = 0$ if $n \notin A$.

  

    Consider a number $x \in (0, 1)$ and its binary expansion $0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots$ where $b_i \in \{0, 1\}$. This gives a map from $(0, 1)$ to $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$. This map is almost a bijection, except for numbers with terminating binary expansions (e.g., $0.1 = 0.1000\dots = 0.0111\dots$).

  

    Consider a map $f : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to (0, 1)$. For a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, let $f(A) = \sum_{n \in A} \frac{2^{-(n+1)}}{3}$. The image of this map is a subset of $[0, 1]$. If $A \neq B$, suppose $k$ is the smallest element in their symmetric difference. Without loss of generality, assume $k \in A$ and $k \notin B$. Then the contribution of the $k$-th term to $f(A)$ is $\frac{2^{-(k+1)}}{3}$, and to $f(B)$ is 0. The sum of all subsequent terms is bounded by $\sum_{i=k+1}^\infty \frac{2^{-(i+1)}}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{2^{-(k+2)}}{1 - 1/2} = \frac{2^{-(k+1)}}{3}$. This shows that $f(A) \neq f(B)$, so $f$ is injective. Since $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable, the cardinality of $(0, 1)$ is at least the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

  

    Consider a map $g : (0, 1) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. For $x \in (0, 1)$, consider its binary expansion $0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots$. Map $x$ to the set $A_x = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : b_n = 1 \}$. This map is not injective due to terminating decimals.

  

    Consider the Cantor set $C$. There is a bijection between $C$ and $\{0, 2\}^\mathbb{N}$, which has the same cardinality as $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. Since $C \subseteq [0, 1]$, the cardinality of $[0, 1]$ is at least the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. Since $(0, 1) \subseteq [0, 1]$, the cardinality of $(0, 1)$ is at most the cardinality of $[0, 1]$.

  

    Map a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ to the real number $0.a_1 a_2 a_3 \dots$ in base 3, where $a_n = 2$ if $n \in A$ and $a_n = 0$ if $n \notin A$. The image is a subset of the Cantor set, which is in $[0, 1]$. This map is injective.

 Prove that if $A \subseteq [0, 1]$ is countable, then Player II has a winning strategy.

  

    Let $A = \{ a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots \}$ be the countable subset of $[0, 1]$. At the first step, Player I chooses $a_1 \in (0, 1)$. Player II chooses $b_1 \in (a_1, 1)$ such that $b_1 \neq a_1$. The interval is $[a_1, b_1]$. At the second step, Player I chooses $a_2 \in (a_1, b_1)$. Player II chooses $b_2 \in (a_2, b_1)$ such that $b_2 \neq a_2$ and if $a_2 \in A$, choose $b_2$ such that $a_2 \notin [a_2, b_2]$.

  

    Winning strategy for Player II: At step $n$, Player I chooses $a_n \in (a_{n-1}, b_{n-1})$. Player II chooses $b_n \in (a_n, b_{n-1})$ such that $b_n \neq a_n$ and $b_n \neq a_k$ for $k \le n$. This is possible since $(a_n, b_{n-1})$ is an open interval containing infinitely many points. The sequence of closed intervals $C_n = [a_n, b_n]$ is nested, so $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n = \{ a \}$ for some $a \in [0, 1]$. Since Player II ensures that $b_n \neq a_k$ for all $k \le n$, the limit $a$ cannot be any of the $a_k$ in the countable set $A$. Thus, $a \notin A$, and Player II wins.

  

    Corollary: $[0, 1]$ is uncountable. If $[0, 1]$ were countable, then by the above, Player II would have a winning strategy for $A = [0, 1]$. This means the limit $a$ would not be in $[0, 1]$, which is a contradiction since $a$ is the limit of a sequence in $[0, 1]$.

 Call a subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ a “Y-set” if it is the union of three straight line segments that share a common endpoint. Prove that any collection of mutually disjoint Y-sets is countable.
    
    Each Y-set contains a point with rational coordinates (in fact, an open neighborhood of any point in a Y-set will contain a point with rational coordinates, unless the Y-set is a single point, which is not the case here as it's a union of segments). If we have an uncountable collection of mutually disjoint Y-sets, we can choose a point with rational coordinates from each Y-set. This would give an uncountable collection of distinct points with rational coordinates in R2. However, the set of points with rational coordinates in R2, Q×Q, is countable. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, any collection of mutually disjoint Y-sets must be countable.
    
    More generally, any subset of Rn that contains a non-empty open set (or a part that contains a non-empty open set in a lower-dimensional subspace it spans) will have the property that any uncountable collection of mutually disjoint such sets must be countable. This is because each such set would contain a point with rational coordinates (in the appropriate dimension), and the set of points with rational coordinates in Rn is countable.
    
    - **O-sets (circles):** An uncountable collection of mutually disjoint circles in R2 would lead to an uncountable collection of distinct centers (we can choose the center with rational coordinates if the radius is also rational, or we can use the fact that each circle contains a point with rational coordinates). Thus, an uncountable collection of mutually disjoint circles is not possible.
        
    - **B-sets:** A B-set contains two disjoint open disks (the "holes"). We can pick a point with rational coordinates from each disk. If we have an uncountable collection of disjoint B-sets, we would get an uncountable collection of pairs of rational points, which is still countable. So, an uncountable collection of mutually disjoint B-sets is not possible.
        
    - **H-sets:** An H-set contains two disjoint horizontal line segments (which contain open intervals). Similar to the B-set case, an uncountable collection of disjoint H-sets would lead to a contradiction with the countability of Q2.

 (Please note, this problem is very hard, not to mention outside the scope of this course.)
    
    We define another game, played on R. Player I starts by picking an uncountable set X1​⊆R. Player II responds by picking an uncountable set X2​⊆X1​. The process then repeats, forming a chain of sets R⊇X1​⊇X2​⊇X3​⊇…. Player I wins if X:=⋂n∈N​Xn​ is nonempty, and Player II wins if X=∅. Prove that Player II always has a winning strategy.
    
    Player II's winning strategy relies on carefully choosing Xn+1​ such that some element is excluded from the intersection at each step.
    
    Strategy for Player II: At step n, having received an uncountable set Xn​ from Player I, Player II picks a countable subset Cn​⊆Xn​ such that Xn​∖Cn​ is still uncountable. Then Player II chooses Xn+1​=Xn​∖{cn​} for some cn​∈Cn​. This ensures Xn+1​⊊Xn​.
    
    A more concrete strategy: At step 1, Player I chooses an uncountable X1​. Player II chooses a countable subset C1​⊆X1​ and lets X2​=X1​∖{c1​} for some c1​∈C1​. X2​ is still uncountable. At step 2, Player I chooses an uncountable X2​⊆X1​. Player II chooses a countable C2​⊆X2​ and lets X3​=X2​∖{c2​} for some c2​∈C2​.
    
    Consider the case where Player II removes one element at each step. Let X1​ be uncountable. Player II picks x1​∈X1​ and sets X2​=X1​∖{x1​}, which is still uncountable. Player I picks an uncountable X2​⊆X1​. Player II picks x2​∈X2​ and sets X3​=X2​∖{x2​}, still uncountable. Then ⋂n∈N​Xn​=X1​∖{x1​,x2​,x3​,…}. If Player II can choose the xn​'s such that they cover all of X1​, then the intersection will be empty. However, Player II's choice depends on Player I's previous move.
    
    Winning Strategy for Player II: At step n, Player I provides an uncountable set Xn​. Player II chooses two distinct elements an​,bn​∈Xn​ and declares that if an​ is in the final intersection, Player II wins, and if bn​ is in the final intersection, Player II wins. Then Player II sets Xn+1​=Xn​∖{an​}. Since Xn​ is uncountable, Xn+1​ is still uncountable. The final intersection ⋂n∈N​Xn​ will not contain any of the an​'s chosen by Player II. However, Player I can potentially force a specific element to remain.
    
    The actual winning strategy for Player II involves a more sophisticated argument, possibly using transfinite induction or a diagonalization-like technique to ensure that any element that could potentially be in the intersection is eventually removed. The core idea is that at each step, Player II can reduce the "size" of the uncountable set in a way that guarantees an empty intersection in the limit. This problem is related to concepts in descriptive set theory.
