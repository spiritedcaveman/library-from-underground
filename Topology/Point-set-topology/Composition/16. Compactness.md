Compactness is invariant

It is not hereditary

Closed subset of a compact subset is compact
	Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $C$. Then by definition of the subspace topology, each $U \in \mathcal{U}$ is of the form $U = C \cap V_U$ for some open set $V_U \in \mathcal{T}$. But then $\mathcal{V} := \{ V_U : U \in \mathcal{U} \} \cup \{ X \setminus C \}$ is an open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $\mathcal{V}$ has a finite subcover of the form $\{ V_{U_1}, V_{U_2}, \dots, V_{U_n}, X \setminus C \}$. But then $\{U_1, U_2, \dots, U_n \}$ is a finite subcover of $\mathcal{U}$, as required.

Compact hausdorff implies regular as well as normal
