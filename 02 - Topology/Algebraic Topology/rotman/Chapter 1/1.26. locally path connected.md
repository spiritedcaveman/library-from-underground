**1.26.** A locally path connected space is locally connected. (Recall that a space is locally connected if every point has a connected open neighborhood.) ($\textit{Hint}$: A space is locally connected if and only if components of open sets are open.)

**1.27.** If $X$ and $Y$ are locally path connected, then so is $X \times Y$.

**1.28.** Every open subset of a locally path connected space is itself locally path connected.
