**1.10.** Let $f: X \to Y$ be an identification, and let $g: Y \to Z$ be a continuous surjection. Then $g$ is an identification if and only if $gf$ is an identification.

**1.11.** Let $X$ and $Y$ be spaces with equivalence relations $\sim$ and $\square$, respectively, and let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous map preserving the relations (if $x \sim x'$, then $f(x) \square f(x')$). Prove that the induced map $\bar{f}: X/\sim \to Y/\square$ is continuous; moreover, if $f$ is an identification, then so is $\bar{f}$.

Let $q_X: X \to X/\sim$ and $q_Y: Y \to Y/\square$ be the quotient maps. Since $f$ preserves the equivalence relations, there is a unique map $\bar{f}: X/\sim \to Y/\square$ such that $\bar{f} \circ q_X = q_Y \circ f$. To prove continuity of $\bar{f}$, let $U \subseteq Y/\square$ be open; then $q_Y^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y$ and, by continuity of $f$, $f^{-1}(q_Y^{-1}(U))$ is open in $X$. But
$$(\bar{f} \circ q_X)^{-1}(U) = q_X^{-1}(\bar{f}^{-1}(U)) = f^{-1}(q_Y^{-1}(U)),$$
so $q_X^{-1}(\bar{f}^{-1}(U))$ is open. Since $q_X$ is a quotient map, this implies $\bar{f}^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X/\sim$. Thus, $\bar{f}$ is continuous.
Now, if $f$ is an identification (i.e. it is surjective and a subset $V \subseteq Y$ is open if and only if $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$), then for any $W \subseteq Y/\square$, note that
$$\bar{f}^{-1}(W) \text{ is open in } X/\sim \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad q_X^{-1}(\bar{f}^{-1}(W)) \text{ is open in } X.$$Using the commutative diagram, we have$$q_X^{-1}(\bar{f}^{-1}(W)) = f^{-1}(q_Y^{-1}(W)).$$
Since $f$ is an identification, $f^{-1}(q_Y^{-1}(W))$ is open in $X$ if and only if $q_Y^{-1}(W)$ is open in $Y$, and because $q_Y$ is a quotient map, this is equivalent to $W$ being open in $Y/\square$. Hence, $\bar{f}$ is an identification.


**1.12.** Let $X$ and $Z$ be compact Hausdorff spaces, and let $h: X \to Z$ be a continuous surjection. Prove that $\varphi: X/\text{ker } h \to Z$, defined by $[x] \mapsto h(x)$, is a homeomorphism.
