1.13. For fixed $t$ with $0 \le t < 1$, prove that $x \mapsto [x, t]$ defines a homeomorphism from a space $X$ to a subspace of $CX$.

Fix $t \in [0,1)$. The map $\varphi_t : X \to CX$ defined by $x \mapsto [x,t]$ is injective since $(x,t) \sim (x',t)$ implies $x = x'$ for $t < 1$ (no identifications off $t=1$). It is continuous as the composition of continuous maps $x \mapsto (x,t)$ and the quotient map $q : X \times I \to CX$. The inverse $\varphi_t^{-1} : \varphi_t(X) \to X$ is continuous because for any open $U \subseteq X$, $q(U \times \{t\}) \cap \varphi_t(X)$ is open in the subspace $\varphi_t(X)$. Hence $\varphi_t$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.

1.14. Prove that $X \mapsto CX$ defines a functor $\mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{Top}$ (the reader must define the behavior on morphisms) (Hint: Use Exercise 1.11).
