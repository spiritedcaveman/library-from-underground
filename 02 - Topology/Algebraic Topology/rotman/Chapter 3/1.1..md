# **3.1.**Generalize Theorem 1.3 as follows. Let $A \subset X$ and $B \subset Y$ be given. Assume that $f_0, f_1: X \to Y$ with $f_0|_A = f_1|_A$ and $f_1(A) \subset B$ for $i=0,1$; assume $g_0, g_1: Y \to Z$ with $g_0|_B = g_1|_B$. If $f_0 \simeq f_1$ rel $A$ and $g_0 \simeq g_1$ rel $B$, then $g_0 \circ f_0 \simeq g_1 \circ f_1$ rel $A$.


# **3.2.**
(i) If $f: I \to X$ is a path with $f(0) = f(1) = x_0 \in X$, then there is a continuous $f': S^1 \to X$ given by $f'(e^{2\pi it}) = f(t)$. If $f, g: I \to X$ are paths with $f(0) = f(1) = x_0 = g(0) = g(1)$ and if $f \simeq g$ rel $\dot{I}$, then $f' \simeq g'$ rel $\{1\}$ (of course, $1 = e^0 \in S^1$). (ii) If $f$ and $g$ are as above, then $f \simeq f_1$ rel $\dot{I}$ and $g \simeq g_1$ rel $\dot{I}$ implies that $f' * g' \simeq f'_1 * g'_1$ rel $\{1\}$. 

# **3.3.** Using Theorem 1.6, show (with the notation of Exercise 3.2) that if $f$ and $g$ are paths with $g$ constant, then $f' \simeq g'$ rel $\{1\}$ if and only if there is a free homotopy $f' \simeq g'$.
