groups on circle

define a function

$\gamma_{n}: S^1 \to S^1$ 
$\gamma(A) = A^{n}$

it's a wrapping across the circle n times in either direction

links are roughy knots with possibly more than one component

borromean rings

# 2D surfaces

1. affine plane $\Bbb{A}^{2}$ $\simeq \Bbb{A}^1 \times \Bbb{A}^1$
   this is nothing but ordered pairing
   
   2. sphere
a) euclidean sphere: $x^{2} + y^{2}+z^{2}=1$ in $\Bbb{A}^{3}$

stereogrphic projection the plane can be intersecting one point or $S^1$

$$
e(h) = \left( \frac{2x}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}, \frac{2y}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}, \frac{1-x^{2}-y^{2}}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}} \right)
$$   $p: \Bbb{A}^{2} \to S^1$ $p([x, y])= (x)$
almost a bijection <--> the point at origin of the sphere is the point at infinity for the plane
