affine line $\Bbb{A}_1$


Circle $S^1$:
a) polynomial equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ also called variety
b) curve: $\varphi(\theta)=(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$ $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$ {transcendental parametrization}

$e(h) \coloneq \left( \frac{1-h^{2}}{1+h^{2}}, \frac{2h}{1+h^{2}} \right)$ $h$ is any number or $\infty$ {rational parametrization}
this is projective parametrization, the ray being originated from $(-1, 0)$ while the circle is centred at the origin

c) moduli space: a space of possibility 
$\Bbb{A}^{2}$ plane and we are interested in one dimensional subspaces of it(lines through origin)

what does space of lines through the origin look like: it is like a circle(justify)
just think of all the light ray and then form the rays, it is same as projective space but the construction is "reverse" ![[Drawing 2025-06-15 21.31.49.excalidraw]]
So the space of 1-dimensional subspaces(projective line)$\coloneq \Bbb{P}^1$ is topologically equivalent to $S^1$
 $$
\Bbb{P}^1 \simeq S^1
$$

d) loop of string/rope in 3D
trefoil knot and it's mirror image
are these two knots(both homeomorphic) equivalent under deformation in $\Bbb{A^{3}}$

e) polygonal representation: 

f) identifying intervals: inserting equivalence in a path/line. take a straight line make two points "same", notice that it is 'connected'

g) use translation on a line: $\Bbb{A}^1$ line $\tau$ is translation to the right by one unit, likewise $\tau^{-1}$ exists
$$
S^1 \simeq \Bbb{A}^1 /\langle \tau, \tau^{-1} \rangle
$$
we look at orbits of $\tau, \tau^{-1}$ and all its iterates on $\Bbb{A}^1$
$S^1$ is just the space of all orbits[take all the possible orbits and see the coset, that is we don't have to move more than one unit to get back to the inital orbit with which we are quotienting out]

Are $\Bbb{A}^1$ and $S^1$ are homeomorphic
