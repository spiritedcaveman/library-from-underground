ω1 is not separable and there for not second countable

(We can assume without loss of generality that all the $B_n$ are nonempty, because the empty ones can be discarded. Now, for each $B_n$, pick any element $x_n \in B_n$. Let $D$ be the set of these $x_n$s. $D$ is clearly countable (because the indexing set for its elements is countable). We claim that $D$ is dense in $X$.

To see this, let $U$ be any nonempty open subset of $X$. Then, $U$ contains some $B_n$, and hence, $x_n \in U$. But by construction, $x_n \in D$, so $D$ intersects $U$, proving that $D$ is dense.)

prop 6.6.

there is a gap above countable $D$ in $\omega 1$ (**Every countable subset of ω1 is bounded above.**)
