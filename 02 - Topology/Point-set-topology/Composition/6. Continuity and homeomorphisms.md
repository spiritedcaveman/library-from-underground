"invrariant" is tied with the notion of homeomorphism 

and we need to check different topological properties to see it it agrees with hom or not to label them "invariant"



**image of a dense set under a continuous, surjective function is dense**

notice that we dont need the whole machinery of hom, prove it:


The usual topology on $\Bbb R^n$ is the product  (or box, since they agree on a finite product) topology, which by definition is the coarsest topology which makes all the projections continuous.
