  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Show that if $U$ is an open subset of $Y$ and $Y$ is an open subset of $X$, then $U$ is an open subset of $X$.

  

2.  Let $A$ be a subspace of $X$. For any $B \subseteq A$, show that $\text{cl}_A(B) = A \cap \text{cl}_X(B)$, where $\text{cl}_X(B)$ denotes the closure of $B$ computed in $X$, and similarly $\text{cl}_A(B)$ denotes the closure of $B$ computed in the subspace topology on $A$.

  

3.  Let $f : X \to Y$ be a continuous function, and let $A$ be a subspace of $X$. Show that the restriction of $f$ to $A$, $f|_A : A \to Y$, is continuous.

  

4.  Let $f : X \to Y$ be a homeomorphism, and let $A$ be a subspace of $X$. Show that $B := f(A)$ is a subspace of $Y$, and $f|_A : A \to B$ is a homeomorphism.

  

5.  Let $B$ be a subspace of $Y$, and let $f : X \to B$ be a continuous function. Show that $f : X \to Y$ is continuous.

  

6.  Prove the Pasting Lemma. That is, let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces, and let $A, B \subseteq X$ be both closed (or both open) subsets of $X$ such that $X = A \cup B$, thought of as subspaces. Suppose $f : A \to Y$ and $g : B \to Y$ are continuous functions that agree on $A \cap B$ (i.e., $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in A \cap B$). Define $h : X \to Y$ by

    $$h(x) = \begin{cases} f(x) & x \in A \\ g(x) & x \in B \end{cases}$$

    Show that $h$ is continuous.

  

7.  Prove that the properties of being countable, first countable, second countable, T0, and T1 are all hereditary.

  

8.  We saw in the lecture notes that separability is not hereditary. Show that an open subspace of a separable space is separable. That is, show that if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is a separable space and $U \subseteq X$ is open, then $U$ with its subspace topology is separable.

  

9.  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. Let $i : A \to X$ be the inclusion function, defined by $i(x) = x$. Show that the subspace topology $A$ inherits from $X$ is the coarsest topology on $A$ such that $i$ is continuous.

  

10. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. $A$ is called sequentially closed if the limit point of every convergent sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$ is in $A$. We already know that every closed set is sequentially closed. $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called sequential if every sequentially closed subset is closed.

    Show that the property of being sequential is a topological invariant.
    
      

11. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces, and let $A \subseteq Y$ be a subspace. If there is a homeomorphism $f : X \to A$, we say that $X$ is embedded in $Y$, and that $f$ is an embedding.

    Give examples of topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that $X$ is embedded in $Y$ and $Y$ is embedded in $X$, but which are not homeomorphic.

  

12. (a) In a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$, show that the property of having a nontrivial clopen subset is a topological invariant.

    (b) In a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ with no nontrivial clopen subsets, show that for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the property of having $n$ cut points is a topological invariant.

    (c) Assuming $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ has no nontrivial clopen subsets, prove that no two of $(0, 1)$, $[0, 1)$, and $[0, 1]$ with their subspace topologies inherited from $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ are homeomorphic.

    (d) Show that $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n_{usual}$ for all $n > 1$.

  

# 13.
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces, and let $f : X \to Y$ be a function. $f$ is called a local homeomorphism if for every $x \in X$ there is an open set $U \subseteq X$ containing $x$ and an open set $V \subseteq Y$ such that $f|_U : U \to V$ is a homeomorphism.

  a) Show that every homeomorphism is a local homeomorphism.

Since $f: X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism, it is already a bijection, continuous, and has a continuous inverse. For any point $p \in X$, we can take the entire space $U = X$ as the open neighbourhood of $p$. now think of $f \restriction X$ i.e. $f$ itself, which is a homeomorphism by assumption.

Thus, every homeomorphism is trivially a local homeomorphism.

 (b) Show that every local homeomorphism is continuous and open, and conclude that a bijective local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism.
   
   Let $f: X \to Y$ be a local homeomorphism. By definition, for every point $p \in X$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $f\restriction U: U \to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism. Since each $f\restriction U$ is continuous, it follows that $f$ is continuous at every point of $X$, hence $f$ is globally continuous.  
   

   (c) Give an example of a map $f : X \to Y$ between topological spaces that is a local homeomorphism but not a homeomorphism.

14. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. The inductive dimension $\text{ind}(X)$ is defined recursively as follows:

    (a) $\text{ind}(\emptyset) = -1$.

    (b) $\text{ind}(X) \le n$ if for every $x \in X$ and every open set $U$ containing $x$, there exists an open set $V$ such that $x \in V \subseteq U$ and $\text{ind}(\partial V) \le n - 1$.

    (c) $\text{ind}(X) = n$ if $\text{ind}(X) \le n$ and $\text{ind}(X) \not\le n - 1$.

    (d) $\text{ind}(X) = \infty$ if $\text{ind}(X) \not\le n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

    (a) Prove that the inductive dimension of a topological space is a topological invariant.

    (b) Prove that if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ has a basis consisting of clopen sets, then $\text{ind}(X) = 0$.

    (c) Prove that $\text{ind}(\mathbb{R}_{usual}) = 1$, $\text{ind}(\mathbb{R}^2_{usual}) = 2$, and $\text{ind}(\mathbb{R}^3_{usual}) = 3$.

  

15. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. Let $i : A \to X$ be the inclusion function. Suppose $\mathcal{T}_A$ is a topology on $A$. Show that $\mathcal{T}_A$ is the subspace topology inherited from $X$ if and only if for any topological space $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ and any function $f : (Y, \mathcal{U}) \to (A, \mathcal{T}_A)$, $f$ is continuous if and only if $i \circ f : Y \to X$ is continuous.
