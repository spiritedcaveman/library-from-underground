 
 This section simply collects together all the exercises mentioned in section 14 of the lecture notes.

# 1.

 Let $I$ be a nonempty indexing set, and let $X$ be a nonempty set. Let $\mathcal{X} = \{ X_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be the indexed family of sets such that $X_\alpha = X$ for all $\alpha \in I$. Show that $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = X^I$.

  Let $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ denote the Cartesian product of the family $\{ X_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in I}$, where each $X_\alpha = X$. By definition,

$$
\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = \{ f : I \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha \mid f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in I \}
$$

Since $X_\alpha = X$ for all $\alpha$, this becomes

$$
\{ f : I \to X \} = X^I
$$

So $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = X^I$ by definition of product and function set.

# 2.

 Fully convince yourself that the definition of an arbitrary Cartesian product extends the usual definition of “ordered n-tuples” for finite products.


if $I$ is countable and it is vacuously finite product
  
  
For a finite indexing set $I = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, the product
$$\prod_{i=1}^n X_i$$
consists of functions $f: I \to \bigcup X_i$ such that $f(i) \in X_i$.

This is just an ordered n-tuple:
$$(f(1), f(2), \dots, f(n))$$
So the function definition of product is equivalent to the usual definition of ordered n-tuples when $I$ is finite.
For infinite $I$, we keep the same idea: functions $f: I \to X$ such that $f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha$. This generalizes the tuple notion to arbitrarily long index sets.

# 3.

 Let $I$ be a nonempty indexing set, and let $\mathcal{X} = \{ X_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of sets such that $X_\alpha = \emptyset$ for at least one $\alpha \in I$. Show that $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = \emptyset$.

  Let $f \in \prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$. Then by definition, $f$ is a function $f: I \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} \mathcal{X}$ such that $f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha$ for all $\alpha \in I$.

But if $X_{\alpha_0} = \emptyset$ for some $\alpha_0 \in I$, then there is no element $x$ such that $f(\alpha_0) = x \in X_{\alpha_0}$. So no such function $f$ can exist.

Hence, $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = \emptyset$.



# 4.

Using the identification $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n - 1\}$, show that $n^k = |n^k|$.

the set $n^k$ denotes the set of all functions from $k = {0, 1, \dots, k - 1}$ to $n$.

Each function $f: k \to n$ can be thought of as a $k$-tuple $(f(0), f(1), \dots, f(k-1))$, where each $f(i) \in n$.

There are $n$ choices for each of the $k$ positions, so the total number of such functions is $n^k$.

Hence, $|n^k| = n^k$.
  
# 5.

 Fully convince yourself that the definition of projection functions given in Definition 2.8 of the lecture notes on Arbitrary Products extends the definition of projection functions we already had for finite products.


Let $X = \prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$, so each element $f \in X$ is a function $f: I \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ such that $f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$.

Define $\pi_\alpha : X \to X_\alpha$ by $\pi_\alpha(f) = f(\alpha)$. This map picks out the $\alpha$-th coordinate of the tuple/function $f$.

In the case where $I = {1, 2, \dots, n}$ and $X_i = X$ for all $i$, each $f \in X$ corresponds to an $n$-tuple $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$.

Then $\pi_i((x_1, \dots, x_n)) = x_i$, which is the usual $i$-th projection map in finite Cartesian products.

Thus, the general definition of $\pi_\alpha(f) = f(\alpha)$ reduces to the familiar projection onto coordinates in the finite case.

---


Here, each $f$ is a function from $I$ to $\bigcup \mathcal{X}$ such that $f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$ — that is, exactly the Cartesian product.

Now for the **projection map** $\pi_\alpha : X \to X_\alpha$ defined by $\pi_\alpha(f) = f(\alpha)$:

This matches the **classical projection** from a tuple to its $\alpha$-th coordinate.  
In the special case where $I = {1,2,\dots,n}$ and $X_\alpha = X$, this gives $X^n$, and $\pi_i(x_1,\dots,x_n) = x_i$.

So yes — this general $\pi_\alpha$ is exactly the old projection map, just expressed in terms of functions rather than tuples.



  
# 6.

 Justify the use of the word “equivalently” in Definition 4.1, which defines the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$.

Let $X = \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N} = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{R}$. Define $\pi_n : X \to \mathbb{R}$ as the coordinate projection $\pi_n(f) = f(n)$.
Suppose $\mathcal{T}$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ such that all $\pi_n$ are continuous. A subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$ is then $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \pi_n^{-1}(U)$, where $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is open. This is precisely $S := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} S_n$.
A basis for $\mathcal{T}$ is then finite intersections of such subbasic sets:
$$\pi_{n_1}^{-1}(U_1) \cap \cdots \cap \pi_{n_k}^{-1}(U_k) = \{ f \in X : f(n_i) \in U_i \text{ for all } i \}$$This is the set of all sequences $f$ such that $f(n_i) \in U_i$ and $f(n) \in \mathbb{R}$ unrestricted elsewhere — i.e., sets of the form:
$$\prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n, \quad \text{where } V_n = \begin{cases} U_i & n = n_i \\ \mathbb{R} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$This matches the standard basis of the product topology. Hence, the topology generated by $S$ is the product topology $T_{\text{prod}}$.

  **finite intersection does the job**
# 7.

# 8.

 Show explicitly that $\mathcal{T}_{prod} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{unif} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{box}$ (as defined on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$).

# 9.
  
 Show explicitly that both of the $\subseteq$'s in the previous exercise are strict (by exhibiting open sets).

  
# 10.

 Show that for an arbitrary product of topological spaces, $\mathcal{T}_{prod} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{box}$, and that this containment is strict for infinite products.

 Show that the property of being Hausdorff is productive.
 Hint: Essentially the same proof we did for $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ works in general here.

# 12.

  Show that the property of being discrete is finitely productive but not countably productive. In particular, you can show that any finite product of discrete spaces is discrete, but that any countable product of nonempty discrete spaces with more than one point is not discrete.

# 17.

 Let $\{y_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{prod}$. Show that the sequence converges to a point $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)$ if and only if the coordinate sequence $\{\pi_k(y_n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to $x_k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

  
# 18.

 Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ be a function, where $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ has the product topology. Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if $\pi_k \circ f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

  
# 19.

 Repeat the two proofs above, but in the context of arbitrary products. In other words, prove  Propositions 7.13 and 7.14 from the lecture notes.
 Hint: The proofs should be almost identical.

# 20.

 Fill in the details of the proofs for Proposition 7.10. In particular, show that separability and metrizability are countably productive.
