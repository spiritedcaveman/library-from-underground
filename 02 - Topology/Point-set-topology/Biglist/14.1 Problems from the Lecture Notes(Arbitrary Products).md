 
 This section simply collects together all the exercises mentioned in section 14 of the lecture notes.

# 1.

 Let $I$ be a nonempty indexing set, and let $X$ be a nonempty set. Let $\mathcal{X} = \{ X_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be the indexed family of sets such that $X_\alpha = X$ for all $\alpha \in I$. Show that $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = X^I$.

  Let $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ denote the Cartesian product of the family $\{ X_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in I}$, where each $X_\alpha = X$. By definition,

$$
\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = \{ f : I \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha \mid f(\alpha) \in X_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in I \}
$$

Since $X_\alpha = X$ for all $\alpha$, this becomes

$$
\{ f : I \to X \} = X^I
$$

So $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = X^I$ by definition of product and function set.

# 2.

 Fully convince yourself that the definition of an arbitrary Cartesian product extends the usual definition of “ordered n-tuples” for finite products.

  
# 3.

 Let $I$ be a nonempty indexing set, and let $\mathcal{X} = \{ X_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be a collection of sets such that $X_\alpha = \emptyset$ for at least one $\alpha \in I$. Show that $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha = \emptyset$.

  

# 4.

Using the identification $n = \{0, 1, \dots, n - 1\}$, show that $n^k = |n^k|$.

  
# 5.

 Fully convince yourself that the definition of projection functions given in Definition 2.8 of the lecture notes on Arbitrary Products extends the definition of projection functions we already had for finite products.

  
# 6.

 Justify the use of the word “equivalently” in Definition 4.1, which defines the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$.

  
# 7.

 Show that the functions $d_1$ and $d_2$ defined in Proposition 4.8 are in fact metrics on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$.

  
# 8.

 Show explicitly that $\mathcal{T}_{prod} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{unif} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{box}$ (as defined on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$).

# 9.
  
 Show explicitly that both of the $\subseteq$'s in the previous exercise are strict (by exhibiting open sets).

  
# 10.

 Show that for an arbitrary product of topological spaces, $\mathcal{T}_{prod} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{box}$, and that this containment is strict for infinite products.

  
# 11.

 Show that the property of being Hausdorff is productive.
 Hint: Essentially the same proof we did for $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ works in general here.

# 12.

  Show that the property of being discrete is finitely productive but not countably productive. In particular, you can show that any finite product of discrete spaces is discrete, but that any countable product of nonempty discrete spaces with more than one point is not discrete.


# 13.

 Directly show that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{box}$ is regular.

  
# 14.

 Directly show that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{box}$ and $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{unif}$ are not ccc.

  
# 15.

 Directly show that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{prod}$ is first countable.

  
# 16.

 Repeat the proof that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{prod}$ is metrizable, but using the metric $d_2$.

  
# 17.

 Let $\{y_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}_{prod}$. Show that the sequence converges to a point $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)$ if and only if the coordinate sequence $\{\pi_k(y_n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to $x_k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

  
# 18.

 Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ be a function, where $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ has the product topology. Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if $\pi_k \circ f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

  
# 19.

 Repeat the two proofs above, but in the context of arbitrary products. In other words, prove  Propositions 7.13 and 7.14 from the lecture notes.
 Hint: The proofs should be almost identical.

# 20.

 Fill in the details of the proofs for Proposition 7.10. In particular, show that separability and metrizability are countably productive.
