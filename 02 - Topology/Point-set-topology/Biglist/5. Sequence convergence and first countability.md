 Prove that every Hausdorff space is T1, and that every T1 space is T0.

Let $X$ be a topological space.

Suppose $X$ is Hausdorff (i.e., $T_2$). Then for any two distinct points $x \ne y$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ with $x \in U$, $y \in V$, and $U \cap V = \emptyset$. In particular, $x \in U$ and $y \notin U$, and similarly $y \in V$, $x \notin V$. So for each $x \ne y$, there exist open sets containing one and not the other. This is exactly the definition of $T_1$.

Now suppose $X$ is $T_1$. Then for any $x \ne y$, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x \in U$, $y \notin U$, and another open set $V$ such that $y \in V$, $x \notin V$. So at least one of these (say $U$) distinguishes $x$ from $y$, i.e., there exists an open set containing one but not the other. This satisfies the $T_0$ condition.

Hence, $T_2 \Rightarrow T_1 \Rightarrow T_0$.

  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a $T_1$ topological space, and let $x \in X$. Show the constant sequence $x, x, x, x, \dots$ converges to $x$ and to no other point.
  
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a $T_1$ space, and consider the constant sequence $x_n = x$.

Since $X$ is $T_1$, for any $r \neq x$, there exists an open set $V$ containing $r$ but not $x$. The sequence $(x_n)$ is never in $V$, so it cannot converge to $r$.
  
# 3.

  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. Prove that the following are equivalent.

  (a) $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is $T_{1}$.
  
  (b) For every $x \in X$, $\{x\}$ is closed.

  (c) Every constant sequence in $X$ converges only to its constant value.

  (d) Every finite subset of $X$ is closed.

  (e) For every subset $A \subseteq X$, $\overline{A} = \bigcap \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open and } A \subseteq U \}$.
  
  
 - 
   For any $x \in X$, we choose an open set $U$ containing $x$ but not any $r \neq x$. Similarly, we choose an open set $V$ containing $r$ but not $x$. Since $V$ is open, we get ${x} = X \setminus V$, which is closed.
   
   If ${x}$ is closed for every $x \in X$, then $X \setminus \{ x \}$ is open. For any distinct $x, r \in X$, the set $X \setminus {r}$ is an open set containing $x$ but not $r$, and $X \setminus {x}$ is an open set containing $r$ but not $x$.
  
-  
   If $X$ is $T_1$, then for each $x_i \in X$, the singleton ${x_i}$ is closed. Since finite unions of closed sets are closed, any finite set ${x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n}$ is closed.


If every finite subset of $X$ is closed, then for each $x \in X$, the singleton ${x}$ is closed (since it is a finite set). By the previous characterization, this implies $X$ is $T_1$.

 $$(X, \mathcal{T}) \quad \text{is} \quad T_1 \iff \forall A \subseteq X, \quad A = \bigcap \{U
 \subseteq X | U \text{ is open and } A \subseteq U\}$$
 
 Suppose $X$ is T$_{1}$. Let $A\subseteq X$. Let $x\in X\setminus A$. For each $a\in A$ there is an open set $U_a$ with $a\in U_a$ and $x\notin U_a$. 
$$\text{now}, U_x:=\bigcup_{a\in A} U_a$$
$U_x$ is open contains $A$, avoids $x$.
$$\text{now}, A=\bigcap _{x\in X\setminus A} U_x$$ so that $A$ is the intersection of all open such $U$'s containing itself

say $X$ is not $T_1$ then for any $x, y \in X$ we don't have such two open sets which contain one but not the other alternatively, every open set $U$ contains both $x, y$ then 'wlog' $\{x\}$ is not intersection of all such open sets which contains itself contradicting the \textbf{4th condition($\forall A ...$)}

   
  
# 4.

 **Let $X$ be uncountable. Show that $(X, \mathcal{T}_{co-countable})$ is not first countable.**

  
Suppose, for contradiction, that $X$ is first countable. Then for some $x \in X$, there exists a countable local base $\{U_n\}$ at $x$. Each $U_n$ is co-countable, so $X \setminus U_n$ is countable. Then:
$$\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n = X \setminus \left( \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} (X \setminus U_n) \right)$$
is the intersection of co-countable sets, so its complement is a countable union of countable sets, hence countable. So the intersection is co-countable—and therefore dense in $X$. But this intersection is supposed to be a neighborhood base at $x$, so it should "pin down" $x$ uniquely in sequences—but it doesn't: any sequence converging to $x$ in this topology also converges to every other point of $X$! (Because every open set is dense.)
Therefore, limits are not unique. So $(X, \mathcal{T}_{\text{co-countable}})$ is not first countable.

# 5.

  **Let $X$ be a finite set. Show that the only T1 topology on $X$ is the discrete topology.**

 If we try the discrete topology, which is the finest, then for all $x \in X$, the set $\{x\}$ is open, contains itself, and contains no other points. This satisfies the criterion for $T_1$.  

Now, if we make the topology any coarser, we must have at least one open set $\{x_1, x_2\}$ such that neither $\{x_1\}$ nor $\{x_2\}$ exists as an open set on its own.

To contradict the hypothesis of $T_1$, simply pick distinct $x_1, x_2$. Since we no longer have the required singleton subsets as open sets, the space fails to be $T_1$.

# 6.

  **Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ be two distinct topologies on $X$ such that $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$. If $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is Hausdorff, does that imply that $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ is Hausdorff? What about the other direction?**

  

If $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$ and $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ is Hausdorff, then $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ is also Hausdorff. This is because any two distinct points in $X$ are separated by disjoint open sets in $\mathcal{T}_1$, and since $\mathcal{T}_2$ is finer, it contains those same sets, so the $T_2$ condition still holds.

The converse fails: $(X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ can be Hausdorff, but $(X, \mathcal{T}_1)$ need not be. For example, take $X = \mathbb{R}$ with $\mathcal{T}_2 = \mathbb{R}_{\text{usual}}$ (Hausdorff) and $\mathcal{T}_1 = \mathbb{R}_{\text{indiscrete}}$, which is strictly coarser and not Hausdorff, since it has no disjoint nonempty open sets.

**So: Hausdorffness is preserved when passing to finer topologies, but not when passing to coarser ones.**

 **Show that every second countable topological space is both separable and first countable.**

  
A second countable space has a countable basis $\{B_n\}$. To show separability, choose a point $x_n \in B_n$ for each nonempty $B_n$. The set $D = \{x_n\}$ is countable. Since every nonempty open set contains some basis element $B_n$, and each $B_n$ intersects $D$, this $D$ is dense. So the space is separable.


For first countability, fix any $a \in X$. The collection of basis elements from $\mathcal{B}$ containing $a$ is a countable local basis at $a$, since $\mathcal{B}$ is countable and open sets are unions of basis elements. So the space is also first countable.

# 8.

Which of the spaces have seen so far in the course are first countable? Which are Hausdorff? This is an exercise you should make a point of doing whenever we define new properties of topological spaces. Essentially, you should be mentally constructing a table like the following one, and filling in “yes” or “no” whenever we learn something new. Most of these have been resolved by examples in the notes or earlier problems, so there isn’t much to think about in most cases.

A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a $G_\delta$ set if it equals a countable intersection of open subsets of $X$. In other words, $A \subseteq X$ is a $G_\delta$ set if there exist open sets $U_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, such that $A = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$.

 Show that in a first countable $T_1$ space, $\{x\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set for every $x \in X$.

  Soln.
  Applying first countablitiy we get $\mathcal{B}_x = \{B_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ be a local basis of $x$. Each $B_n$ is open (by assumption).
  
  Applying the $T_1$ property, if $x \neq y$, we get an open set $U$ such that $x \in U$ and $y \notin U$ (WLOG). Now, $$x\in \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} B_n\subset \bigcap_{x\in U,\text{$U$ open}} U$$ Thus, $\{x\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set $\forall x \in X$
  
# 10.

 A topological space is called a $G_\delta$ space if every closed set is $G_\delta$. Give an example of a space that is not a $G_\delta$ space.

outsider:
So maybe even try with a singleton.



  $$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_{\text{cofinite}})$$
  
  The closed sets are exactly the finite subsets and $\mathbb{R}$ itself.
Now consider the singleton set $\{x\}$ for some $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This is closed, since its complement is cofinite.
Suppose for contradiction that $\{x\}$ is a $G_\delta$ set. Then there exist open sets $U_n$ in the cofinite topology such that
$$\{x\} = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n.$$Each $U_n$ is cofinite, so its complement $\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n$ is finite. Hence,$$\mathbb{R} \setminus \{x\} = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (\mathbb{R} \setminus U_n)$$
is a countable union of finite sets, which is countable.
But $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{x\}$ is uncountable, so this is a contradiction.
Thus, $\{x\}$ is a closed set that is not a $G_\delta$, and so $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_{\text{cofinite}})$ is not a $G_\delta$ space.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a **first countable** topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. Prove that $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if there is a sequence of elements of $A$ converging to $x$.

Every open neighbourhood $U$ of arbitrary $x$ contains atleast a $x_n$, so $U \cap A = \emptyset$ implying $x \in \bar A$

So, using the first countability, we get the countably nested basis $\mathcal{B}_k \quad \forall x \in \bar{A}$ as we get $\forall x \in X$ we are meeting the very condition.  

Now, as the members of the sequence are countable, they can be covered by some generated nested local basis, i.e.,  

$$\forall n, \exists x_n \in B_n = \bigcap_{k=1}^{n} \mathcal{B}_k \cap A$$
notice how the open sets are going down on the point which is the essence of **countable nested local basis for first countability

# 12.

 Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a **first countable** topological space. Show that every $x \in X$ has a countable nested local basis. That is, for every $x \in X$, show that there is a local basis $\mathcal{B}_x = \{ B_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ such that $B_1 \supseteq B_2 \supseteq B_3 \supseteq \dots$.

as $X$ is first-countable, each $x \in X$ has a countable local basis $\mathcal{B}_x = \{U_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, where each $U_n$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$


now consider a nested local basis $\{B_n\}$ as following  

$$B_n = \bigcap_{k=1}^{n} U_k$$

it follows that:  
$$  
B_1 \supseteq B_2 \supseteq B_3 \supseteq \cdots.  
$$

by hypothesis given any open set $U \ni x$,  $\exists U_m \in \mathcal{B}_x$ such that $U_m \subseteq U$, and by our construction, $B_m \subseteq U_m \subseteq U$ imples that ${B_n}$ surely is a local basis.
  
  ---
  
  Since $X$ is first countable, every point $x \in X$ has a countable local basis $\{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ consisting of open sets containing $x$. Define $B_n := \bigcap_{k=1}^n U_k$. Each $B_n$ is open, contains $x$, and the sequence is nested: $B_1 \supseteq B_2 \supseteq \cdots$. Given any open set $U$ containing $x$, some $U_m \subseteq U$ exists, and since $B_m \subseteq U_m$, we get $B_m \subseteq U$. Hence $\{B_n\}$ is a countable nested local basis at $x$.

# 13.

 Is every countable topological space (i.e., one in which the underlying set is countable) separable? What about ccc? Can a countable space be first countable but not second countable?


Yes, every countable topological space is separable, because the whole space is countable and any dense subset must intersect every nonempty open set, so taking $X$ itself gives a countable dense subset regardless of the topology.

Every countable topological space also satisfies the countable chain condition (ccc). If there were uncountably many pairwise disjoint nonempty open sets, then each would have to contain at least one distinct point of $X$, contradicting the countability of $X$.

---

Let $X$ be a countable topological space.

If $X$ is first-countable then every $x \in X$ has a countable local basis $\mathcal{B}_x$. Taking $\mathcal{B} := \bigcup_{x \in X} \mathcal{B}_x$, we get a countable union of countable sets, hence countable. Now, for any open set $U$ and any $x \in U$, some $B \in \mathcal{B}_x$ exists with $x \in B \subseteq U$, so $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis. Hence $X$ is second-countable.

Conversely, if $X$ is second-countable, then there exists a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$. For each $x \in X$, define $\mathcal{B}_x := \{B \in \mathcal{B} : x \in B\}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is countable, so is each $\mathcal{B}_x$, and it vacuously forms a local basis at $x$. So $X$ is first-countable.

   Construct a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ which is countable (i.e., $X$ is countable) but not first countable.
   
   (Note, no topological space we have seen so far does this. You really have to construct a new space from scratch. Feel free to do some research on the subject, but not before you spend some time thinking about it.)


Let $\mathcal{T}=\{\emptyset\} \cup \{\mathbb{R}\setminus F: F\subset\mathbb{R},\ F\ \text{finite}\}$, the cofinite topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Suppose for contradiction that $x\in\mathbb{R}$ has a countable local basis $\{B_n\}$ with each $B_n=\mathbb{R}\setminus F_n$, $F_n$ finite. Then $C=\{x\}\cup\bigcup_n F_n$ is countable, so since $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, pick $y\in\mathbb{R}\setminus C$. Let $U=\mathbb{R}\setminus\{y\}$, which is open and contains $x$, but no $B_n\subseteq U$ since $y\in B_n$ for all $n$. Hence $\{B_n\}$ fails to be a local basis at $x$. So no point in $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable local basis, and the space is not first countable.



Let $X = \mathbb{N}$ and define:
$$\mathcal{T} = \{\varnothing\} \cup \{ U \subseteq \mathbb{N} : 1 \in U \}$$

Suppose $\{U_n\}$ is a countable local base at $1$, with each $U_n \in \mathcal{T}$. Then each $U_n$ contains $1$, and possibly some other natural numbers. But their intersection must still contain $1$, so $\bigcap_n U_n$ is some subset $A$ containing $1$.

Now pick any $k \ne 1$ not in $A$ (since $\mathbb{N}$ is infinite, such a $k$ exists). Then consider the open set $U = \{1\} \cup \mathbb{N} \setminus \{k\}$. This is open (it contains 1), and $1 \in U$, but no $U_n \subseteq U$ since each $U_n$ includes $k$. So $\{U_n\}$ wasn't a local base. Hence the space is not first countable at 1, and similar arguments hold at other points too.



Take $X = \mathbb{Q} \cup \{\infty\}$

Define a topology: any set not containing $\infty$ is open if it's open in the usual topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. But if it does contain $\infty$, then it's open iff its intersection with $\mathbb{Q}$ is open and dense in $\mathbb{Q}$.

Now, $X$ is clearly countable.

Suppose we had a countable local basis $\{U_n\}$ at $\infty$, then each $U_n \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is dense open in $\mathbb{Q}$, so the intersection of all of them is still dense. Pick any $q$ in this dense intersection. Then $V = X \setminus \{q\}$ is open (it contains $\infty$ and intersects $\mathbb{Q}$ in a dense open set), but $q$ lies in every $U_n$, so $U_n \not\subseteq V$ for all $n$. This contradicts $U_n$ being a basis at $\infty$.


Take $X = (\mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{N}) \cup \{\infty\}$, 
Define a topology on $X$:

- Any subset of $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ that’s open in the usual topology is open.
- A set containing $\infty$ is open iff it equals $U \cup \{\infty\}$, where $U \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ is open and for every $n$, there’s some $m > n$ with $m \in U$.


This gives a countable topological space $X$, but at $\infty$ there’s no countable local basis: any countable collection of such neighborhoods misses infinitely many naturals, so their intersection fails to be cofinal. Hence $X$ is not first countable.
