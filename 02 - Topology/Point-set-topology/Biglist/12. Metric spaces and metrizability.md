 Show that the functions defined in each part of Example 2.2 in the lecture notes on Metric Spaces and Metrizability are actually metrics
 Hint: One part of this is actually kind of tricky : showing that $d_2(f, g) = \sqrt{\int_0^1 |f(x) - g(x)|^2 dx}$ satisfies the triangle inequality. For that you will need the following version of **Hölder’s Inequality**  :

$$\int_0^1 |f_1(x)f_2(x)| dx \le \left( \int_0^1 |f_1(x)|^2 dx \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_0^1 |f_2(x)|^2 dx \right)^{1/2}$$


For $d_1(f,g) = \int_0^1 |f(x) - g(x)| \, dx$, non-negativity holds since the integrand is non-negative. If $d_1(f,g) = 0$, then $\int_0^1 |f(x) - g(x)| \, dx = 0$, and since $|f(x) - g(x)|$ is continuous and non-negative, it must be zero everywhere, so $f = g$. Symmetry follows as $|f(x) - g(x)| = |g(x) - f(x)|$. For the triangle inequality, note that $|f(x) - h(x)| \leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)|$; integrating gives $\int_0^1 |f(x) - h(x)| \, dx \leq \int_0^1 |f(x) - g(x)| \, dx + \int_0^1 |g(x) - h(x)| \, dx$, so $d_1(f,h) \leq d_1(f,g) + d_1(g,h)$.

For $d_2(f,g) = \left( \int_0^1 (f(x) - g(x))^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2}$, non-negativity is clear as the integrand is non-negative. If $d_2(f,g) = 0$, then $\int_0^1 (f(x) - g(x))^2 \, dx = 0$, implying $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x$, since the integrand is continuous. Symmetry holds since $(f(x) - g(x))^2 = (g(x) - f(x))^2$. For the triangle inequality, we need $d_2(f,h) \leq d_2(f,g) + d_2(g,h)$. Let $u = f - g$, $v = g - h$, so $f - h = u + v$. We must show $\left( \int_0^1 (u + v)^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} \leq \left( \int_0^1 u^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} + \left( \int_0^1 v^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2}$. Square both sides: $\int_0^1 (u + v)^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 u^2 \, dx + 2 \int_0^1 u v \, dx + \int_0^1 v^2 \, dx$. By Hölder’s inequality, $\int_0^1 |u v| \, dx \leq \left( \int_0^1 u^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_0^1 v^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2}$, so $2 \int_0^1 u v \, dx \leq 2 \left( \int_0^1 u^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} \left( \int_0^1 v^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2}$. Thus, the left-hand side is at most $\left( \left( \int_0^1 u^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} + \left( \int_0^1 v^2 \, dx \right)^{1/2} \right)^2$, proving the inequality after taking square roots.

For $d_\infty(f,g) = \max_{x \in [0,1]} |f(x) - g(x)|$, non-negativity is immediate. If $d_\infty(f,g) = 0$, then $|f(x) - g(x)| = 0$ for all $x$, so $f = g$. Symmetry is clear. For the triangle inequality, note that $|f(x) - h(x)| \leq |f(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)| \leq \max |f - g| + \max |g - h|$ for all $x$. Taking the maximum over $x$, we get $d_\infty(f,h) \leq d_\infty(f,g) + d_\infty(g,h)$. All three satisfy the metric properties.

 Let $(X_1, \mathcal{T}_1)$ and $(X_2, \mathcal{T}_2)$ be metrizable spaces. Prove that $X_1 \times X_2$ with its product topology is metrizable. (Hint: Complete the proof of Proposition 4.3 in the lecture notes.)
 
 Let $(X_1, \mathcal{T}_1)$ and $(X_2, \mathcal{T}_2)$ be metrizable with metrics $d_1$ and $d_2$, respectively. Define a metric on $X_1 \times X_2$ by $d((x_1, x_2), (y_1, y_2)) = \sqrt{d_1(x_1, y_1)^2 + d_2(x_2, y_2)^2}$. Verify it’s a metric: non-negativity and identity of indiscernibles follow since $d_1, d_2$ are metrics; symmetry is clear. For the triangle inequality, note $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq \sqrt{(a' + a'')^2 + (b' + b'')^2} \leq \sqrt{a'^2 + b'^2} + \sqrt{a''^2 + b''^2}$ if $a \leq a' + a''$, $b \leq b' + b''$, which holds by $d_1, d_2$ triangle inequalities. The product topology on $X_1 \times X_2$ has basis sets $U_1 \times U_2$, $U_i \in \mathcal{T}_i$. A basic open set in the metric topology is a ball $B_d((x_1, x_2), \epsilon) = \{ (y_1, y_2) : \sqrt{d_1(x_1, y_1)^2 + d_2(x_2, y_2)^2} < \epsilon \}$. If $(y_1, y_2) \in B_d((x_1, x_2), \epsilon)$, then $d_i(x_i, y_i) < \epsilon/\sqrt{2}$, so $B_d((x_1, x_2), \epsilon) \subseteq B_{d_1}(x_1, \epsilon/\sqrt{2}) \times B_{d_2}(x_2, \epsilon/\sqrt{2})$. Conversely, for $U_1 \times U_2 \ni (x_1, x_2)$, choose $\epsilon_i$ such that $B_{d_i}(x_i, \epsilon_i) \subseteq U_i$, and let $\epsilon = \min(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2)$. Then $B_d((x_1, x_2), \epsilon) \subseteq U_1 \times U_2$. Thus, the topologies coincide, and $X_1 \times X_2$ is metrizable.

 Prove that every metrizable space is Hausdorff.

It essentialy boils down to showing that metric spaces are Hausdorff. Take $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Then $d(x,y) > 0$. Can you check that $$B\left(x,\frac{d(x,y)}{2} \right) \cap B\left(y,\frac{d(x,y)}{2}\right) = \varnothing?$$You should convince yourself with a drawing. To prove it formally, take $z$ in that intersection and get a contradiction using the triangle inequality.

any radius less than the half do the job


Take $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Since $d$ is a metric, $d(x, y) > 0$. Define open balls $U = B\left(x, \frac{d(x, y)}{2}\right) = \{ z \in X : d(x, z) < \frac{d(x, y)}{2} \}$ and $V = B\left(y, \frac{d(x, y)}{2}\right) = \{ z \in X : d(y, z) < \frac{d(x, y)}{2} \}$. These are open sets in the metric topology. To show $U \cap V = \emptyset$, suppose $z \in U \cap V$. Then $d(x, z) < \frac{d(x, y)}{2}$ and $d(y, z) < \frac{d(x, y)}{2}$. By the triangle inequality, $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) = d(x, z) + d(y, z) < \frac{d(x, y)}{2} + \frac{d(x, y)}{2} = d(x, y)$. This implies $d(x, y) < d(x, y)$, a contradiction. Thus, $U \cap V = \emptyset$. Hence, $X$ is Hausdorff.

Let $X = C[0, 1]$ be the set of all continuous functions $f : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ (where the domain and   codomain have their usual topologies). The function $d_1 : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ given by

$$d_1(f, g) = \int_0^1 |f(x) - g(x)| dx$$is a metric on $X$. Show that the function $F : X \to \mathbb{R}$ given by$$F(f) = \int_0^1 f(x) dx$$

is continuous (where $X$ has the metric topology generated by $d_1$, and $\mathbb{R}$ has its usual topology).


Let $f \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$. We need $|F(f) - F(g)| = \left| \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx - \int_0^1 g(x) \, dx \right| < \epsilon$ when $d_1(f,g) < \delta$. Compute:

$$|F(f) - F(g)| = \left| \int_0^1 (f(x) - g(x)) \, dx \right| \leq \int_0^1 |f(x) - g(x)| \, dx = d_1(f,g),$$

since the absolute value of an integral is at most the integral of the absolute value. Choose $\delta = \epsilon$. If $d_1(f,g) < \delta = \epsilon$, then:

$$|F(f) - F(g)| \leq d_1(f,g) < \epsilon.$$

Thus, $F$ is continuous at $f$. Since $f$ was arbitrary, $F$ is continuous on $X$.

 This exercise completes the proof of Proposition 7.2 from the lecture notes.
  Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Define $\bar{d} : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ by $\bar{d}(x, y) = \min\{1, d(x, y)\}$. Also define $d_0 : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ by

$$d_0(x, y) = \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)}.$$

**(a) Prove $\bar{d}$ and $d_0$ are metrics:**
For $\bar{d}(x, y) = \min\{1, d(x, y)\}$, non-negativity and identity of indiscernibles follow since $d(x, y) \geq 0$ and $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. Symmetry holds as $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$, so $\min\{1, d(x, y)\} = \min\{1, d(y, x)\}$. For the triangle inequality, consider $\bar{d}(x, z) \leq \bar{d}(x, y) + \bar{d}(y, z)$. If $d(x, z) \geq 1$, then $\bar{d}(x, z) = 1 \leq 2 = \min\{1, d(x, y)\} + \min\{1, d(y, z)\}$. If $d(x, z) < 1$, then $\bar{d}(x, z) = d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z) \leq \min\{1, d(x, y)\} + \min\{1, d(y, z)\}$, since $d(x, y) \leq \min\{1, d(x, y)\}$.

For $d_0(x, y) = \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)}$, non-negativity and identity hold since $d(x, y) \geq 0$ and $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. Symmetry is clear. For the triangle inequality, note the function $f(t) = \frac{t}{1 + t}$ is increasing and concave on $[0, \infty)$, and $f(a + b) \leq f(a) + f(b)$ for $a, b \geq 0$ (since $f''(t) = -\frac{2}{(1 + t)^3} \leq 0$). Thus, $d_0(x, z) = f(d(x, z)) \leq f(d(x, y) + d(y, z)) \leq f(d(x, y)) + f(d(y, z)) = d_0(x, y) + d_0(y, z)$.

**(b) Prove $(X, \bar{d})$ and $(X, d_0)$ are bounded:** A metric space is bounded if there exists $M > 0$ such that the distance between any two points is at most $M$.

For $\bar{d}$, since $\bar{d}(x, y) = \min\{1, d(x, y)\} \leq 1$, take $M = 1$, so $(X, \bar{d})$ is bounded.
For $d_0$, since $d_0(x, y) = \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)} < 1$ (as $d(x, y) \geq 0$), take $M = 1$, so $(X, d_0)$ is bounded.

**(c) Prove $\bar{d}$ and $d_0$ generate $\mathcal{T}_d$:** A metric $d'$ generates $\mathcal{T}_d$ if their open balls generate the same topology. For $\bar{d}$, if $r < 1$, then $B_{\bar{d}}(x, r) = B_d(x, r)$, as $\bar{d}(x, y) = d(x, y) < r$. If $r \geq 1$, then $B_{\bar{d}}(x, r) = X = B_d(x, s)$ for large $s$. Thus, $\mathcal{T}_{\bar{d}} = \mathcal{T}_d$. For $d_0$, the function $f(t) = \frac{t}{1 + t}$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and bijective from $[0, \infty)$ to $[0, 1)$. For any $r < 1$, there exists $s > 0$ such that $f(s) = r$, so $B_{d_0}(x, r) = \{y : \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)} < r\} = \{y : d(x, y) < s\} = B_d(x, s)$. Conversely, for $B_d(x, s)$, choose $r = f(s/2)$, so if $d_0(x, y) < r$, then $d(x, y) < s$, implying $B_{d_0}(x, r) \subseteq B_d(x, s)$. Thus, $\mathcal{T}_{d_0} = \mathcal{T}_d$.

Let $(X_1, d_1)$ and $(X_2, d_2)$ be metric spaces. Let $f : X_1 \to X_2$ be a surjective isometry. Prove that $f$ is a homeomorphism of topological spaces (where $X_1$ and $X_2$ have their metric topologies    generated by $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively).



For continuity of $f$, let $x \in X_1$ and $\epsilon > 0$. If $d_1(x, y) < \epsilon$, then $d_2(f(x), f(y)) = d_1(x, y) < \epsilon$, so $f(B_{d_1}(x, \epsilon)) \subseteq B_{d_2}(f(x), \epsilon)$. Thus, $f$ is continuous (in fact, uniformly continuous with $\delta = \epsilon$).

Since $f$ is surjective, we need to show it is injective and that $f^{-1}$ is continuous.

For injectivity, if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $d_2(f(x), f(y)) = 0 = d_1(x, y)$, so $x = y$, proving $f$ is injective. Thus, $f$ is bijective with inverse $f^{-1}: X_2 \to X_1$.

Since $f$ is an isometry, for $u, v \in X_2$, let $x = f^{-1}(u)$, $y = f^{-1}(v)$. Then $d_1(f^{-1}(u), f^{-1}(v)) = d_1(x, y) = d_2(f(x), f(y)) = d_2(u, v)$, so $f^{-1}$ is an isometry. Applying the same argument as for $f$, $f^{-1}$ is continuous: if $d_2(u, v) < \epsilon$, then $d_1(f^{-1}(u), f^{-1}(v)) = d_2(u, v) < \epsilon$. Hence, $f$ is a homeomorphism.

Prove that every metrizable space is regular.
(Hint: This exercise and the next one are two-star problems if you’re seeing the ideainvolved for the first time. For us though, you can mirror the proofs that $\mathbb{R}_\text{usual}$ is regular and normal.)

Let $(X, d)$ be a metrizable space with topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ induced by metric $d$. To prove $X$ is regular, we must show that for any point $x \in X$ and closed set $C \subseteq X$ with $x \notin C$, there exist open sets $U, V \in \mathcal{T}_d$ such that $x \in U$, $C \subseteq V$, and $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

Since $C$ is closed, $X \setminus C$ is open, so there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B_d(x, \epsilon) = \{ y \in X : d(x, y) < \epsilon \} \subseteq X \setminus C$. Define $U = B_d(x, \epsilon/2)$ and $V = \bigcup_{y \in C} B_d(y, \epsilon/2)$. Since $V$ is a union of open balls, it is open and contains $C$. To show $U \cap V = \emptyset$, suppose $z \in U \cap V$. Then $z \in B_d(x, \epsilon/2)$, so $d(x, z) < \epsilon/2$, and $z \in B_d(y, \epsilon/2)$ for some $y \in C$, so $d(y, z) < \epsilon/2$. By the triangle inequality, $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) < \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon$. Thus, $y \in B_d(x, \epsilon) \subseteq X \setminus C$, a contradiction since $y \in C$. Hence, $U \cap V = \emptyset$, and $X$ is regular.

Prove that every metrizable space is normal.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metrizable space with topology $\mathcal{T}_d$ induced by metric $d$. To prove $X$ is normal, we must show that for any disjoint closed sets $C, D \subseteq X$, there exist open sets $U, V \in \mathcal{T}_d$ such that $C \subseteq U$, $D \subseteq V$, and $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

For each $x \in C$, since $D$ is closed and $x \notin D$, there exists $\epsilon_x > 0$ such that $B_d(x, \epsilon_x) \cap D = \emptyset$. Similarly, for each $y \in D$, since $C$ is closed and $y \notin C$, there exists $\delta_y > 0$ such that $B_d(y, \delta_y) \cap C = \emptyset$. Define $U = \bigcup_{x \in C} B_d(x, \epsilon_x/2)$ and $V = \bigcup_{y \in D} B_d(y, \delta_y/2)$. These are open sets and contain $C$ and $D$, respectively. To show $U \cap V = \emptyset$, suppose, for contradiction, that $z \in U \cap V$. Then there exists $x \in C$ such that $z \in B_d(x, \epsilon_x/2)$, so $d(x, z) < \epsilon_x/2$. Also, there exists $y \in D$ such that $z \in B_d(y, \delta_y/2)$, so $d(y, z) < \delta_y/2$. By the triangle inequality, $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) < \epsilon_x/2 + \delta_y/2$. Now, if $d(x, y) < \epsilon_x$, this contradicts our choice of $\epsilon_x$ such that $B_d(x, \epsilon_x) \cap D = \emptyset$ (since $y \in D$). Similarly, if $d(x, y) < \delta_y$, this contradicts our choice of $\delta_y$ such that $B_d(y, \delta_y) \cap C = \emptyset$ (since $x \in C$). Specifically, we have $d(x, y) < \epsilon_x/2 + \delta_y/2$. Without loss of generality, assume $\epsilon_x \leq \delta_y$. Then $d(x, y) < \epsilon_x/2 + \delta_y/2 \leq \delta_y/2 + \delta_y/2 = \delta_y$. This implies $x \in B_d(y, \delta_y)$, which contradicts $B_d(y, \delta_y) \cap C = \emptyset$ as $x \in C$. Thus, $U \cap V = \emptyset$, and $X$ is normal.

This is a multi-part, guided exercise in which you are going to prove that every metrizable ccc space is second countable, completing the proof of Proposition 5.3 from the lecture notes. You will actually prove that a metrizable ccc space is separable, and then that a metrizable separable space is second countable.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a metrizable, topological space with the countable chain condition. Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ that generates the topology $\mathcal{T}$. All $\epsilon$-balls we refer to below will be with respect to this metric.

(a) Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Show that there exists a maximal collection of mutually disjoint $\frac{1}{n}$-balls in $X$.
(Maximal with respect to inclusion. That is, show that there is a collection $\mathcal{B}_n$ of mutually disjoint $\frac{1}{n}$-balls in $X$ that is not properly contained in any larger such collection.)
(Hint: Use Zorn’s Lemma.)

(b) For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, suppose $\mathcal{B}_n$ is a collection as in the previous part. Let $C_n \subseteq X$ be the collection of centres of the balls in $\mathcal{B}_n$, and finally let $C = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n$. Show that $C$ is a countable, dense subset of $X$. Conclude that $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is separable.
(Hint: First, show that $C$ is countable. Next, to show it’s dense, do a proof by contradiction. Suppose $C$ is not dense, and fix an open set $U$ such that $C \cap U = \emptyset$. After a little bit of work, you can contradict the maximality of one of the $\mathcal{B}_n$'s.)
Conclude from this and the previous part that any metrizable ccc space is separable.

(c) Now that we know that $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is separable. Prove that every separable metrizable space is second countable. (Hint: Use the fact that every point in a metric space has a particularly nice countable local basis.)

In this exercise you are going to learn about two types of convergence of sequences of functions that are very important to analysis, and prove an important fact about one of them

**Definition 12.1.**** Let $X$ be a set and let $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be a topological space. Let $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of functions $f_n : X \to Y$. We say that the sequence converges pointwise to a function $f : X \to Y$ if the sequence $\{f_n(x)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $f(x)$ for all $x \in X$.

**Definition 12.2.** Let $X$ be a set and let $(Y, d)$ be a metric space. Let $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of functions $f_n : X \to Y$. We say that the sequence converges uniformly to a function $f : X \to Y$ if for all $\epsilon > 0$ there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $d(f_n(x), f(x)) < \epsilon$ for all $n > N$ and for all $x \in X$.

(a) Let $X$ be a set and $(Y, d)$ a metric space, also thought of as a topological space with the topology generated by $d$. Suppose $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of functions $f_n : X \to Y$ that converges uniformly to a function $f$. Show that $\{f_n\}$ also converges pointwise to $f$.

(b) Find a sequence of continuous functions $f_n : [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ that converges pointwise to the zero function, but does not converge uniformly to anything. (Here, $[0, 1]$ has its usual topology generated by its usual metric.)


 (c) Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and $(Y, d)$ a metric space (also thought of as a topological space with the topology generated by $d$). Suppose $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of continuous functions $f_n : X \to Y$ that converges uniformly to a function $f$. Show that $f$ must also be continuous.

(Hint: This is an “$\epsilon/3$ proof”.)

# 12.

 This proof is quite easy, but it requires two new definitions. Neither of them are tricky.
 
 **Definition 12.3.** Let $X$ be a set and $f : X \to X$ a function. A point $x \in X$ is called a fixed point of $f$ if $f(x) = x$.

**Definition 12.4.** Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. A function $f : X \to X$ is called a contraction if there is an $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ such that $d(f(x), f(y)) \le \alpha d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$.

So, a contraction is just a map that decreases the distance between all pairs of points, by at least a fixed amount.

(a) Give an example of a metric space $(X, d)$ and a map $f : X \to X$ such that $d(f(x), f(y)) < d(x, y)$ for every distinct $x, y \in X$, but such that $f$ is not a contraction.

(a) Give an example of a metric space $(X, d)$ and a map $f : X \to X$ such that $d(f(x), f(y)) < d(x, y)$ for every distinct $x, y \in X$, but such that $f$ is not a contraction.

$$
\left([0,1], d(x,y) = |x-y|\right), \quad f(x) = \frac{x}{1+x} \quad f(x) = x^{2}
$$
  

(b) Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Prove that every contraction $f : X \to X$ has at most one fixed point.

Assume there are two distinct fixed points, say $p, q \in X$ with $p \neq q$, such that $f(p) = p$ and $f(q) = q$. Then, compute the distance between them: $d(p, q) = d(f(p), f(q)) \leq \alpha d(p, q)$. Since $p \neq q$, we have $d(p, q) > 0$, so dividing through by $d(p, q)$, we get $1 \leq \alpha$. This contradicts the assumption that $\alpha < 1$. Hence, $p = q$, and $f$ can have at most one fixed point.
  
  If $a'$ and $a$ are fixed points, then $d(f(a'),f(a))=d(a',a)<\lambda d(a',a)$ with $0<\lambda <1$, which implies that $d(a,a')=0$ and hence $a=a'$.
# 13.

Let $F$ be a fixed, finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Prove that there is a unique closed ball of **minimal radius** containing all the points in $F$.
This result is true in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for all $n$. You may find it interesting to think about how you would have to modify your proof in higher dimensions (if at all).
If you’re a computer scientist, you should try to design an efficient algorithm that finds this ball. Try to do better than $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of points in $F$.
  
  
  Let $F=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a finite set.

Existence:

The set of all closed balls containing $F$ is nonempty (e.g., a large ball around all points).

Define
$r^* := \inf\{r \geq 0 \mid \exists x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \text{ s.t. } F \subseteq \overline{B}(x, r)\}.$The infimum is attained since closed balls are compact in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $F$ is finite $\rightarrow$ the minimal enclosing ball exists.
Uniqueness:

Suppose two minimal balls $\overline{B}(x_1,r^*)$ and $\overline{B}(x_2,r^*)$ enclose $F$, with $x_1\neq x_2$.

Then the convex hull of the union of these balls contains $F$, and the center of the segment joining $x_1$ and $x_2$ gives a strictly smaller enclosing ball — contradiction.

Hence, the minimal ball is unique.

 **Theorem 12.5 (Contraction Mapping Theorem).** Let $(X, d)$ be a complete metric space, also thought of as a topological space with the topology generated by $d$. Let $f : X \to X$ be a contraction. Then $f$ has exactly one fixed point.
 
 Hint: The core idea of the proof is illustrated by this image.

 Prove the **Baire Category theorem**: if $(X, d)$ is a complete metric space, then the intersection of countably many dense, open subsets of $X$ is dense.
