 Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^k$ be continuous in the first-/second-year calculus sense. That is, for every $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $x \in B_\delta(a) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ implies $f(x) \in B_\epsilon(f(a)) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$. Show that $f$ is continuous in the topological sense we have defined.

Soln.
$f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^k$ is continuous in the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ sense: $\forall a \in \mathbb{R}^n, \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ s.t. $x \in B_\delta(a) \Rightarrow f(x) \in B_\epsilon(f(a))$.

 Given any open $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$, $\forall a \in f^{-1}(U)$, $f(a) \in U$ and $\exists \epsilon > 0$ with $B_\epsilon(f(a)) \subseteq U$. Then, $\exists \delta > 0$ s.t. $B_\delta(a) \subseteq f^{-1}(B_\epsilon(f(a))) \subseteq f^{-1}(U)$, showing $f^{-1}(U)$ is open. Thus, $f$ is continuous in the topological sense.

Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ be two topologies on $X$. Show that the identity function $\operatorname{id} : (X, \mathcal{T}_1) \to (X, \mathcal{T}_2)$ given by $\text{id}(x) = x$ is continuous **if and only if** $\mathcal{T}_1$ refines $\mathcal{T}_2$.

  Soln.
If $T_1$ refines $T_2$, i.e., $T_2 \subseteq T_1$, then for all $U \in T_2$, we have $id^{-1}(U) = U \in T_1$, so $\operatorname{id}$ is continuous.
 
Conversely, if $\operatorname{id}$ is continuous, then $\forall U \in T_2$, $id^{-1}(U) = U$ is open in $T_1$, so $T_2 \subseteq T_1$, meaning $T_1$ refines $T_2$.

Show that addition and multiplication, thought of as functions from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with their usual topologies, are continuous functions. (That is, show that the map $+ : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $(x, y) \mapsto x + y$ is continuous). For this problem it will be useful to use one of the equivalent definitions of continuity given in the lecture notes.

  Soln.
  For $+: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be open. For any $(a,b) \in f^{-1}(U)$, we have $a+b \in U$. Since $U$ is open, $\exists \epsilon > 0$ with $(a+b-\epsilon, a+b+\epsilon) \subseteq U$. The set  

$$
V = \{(x, y) \mid x+y \in (a+b-\epsilon, a+b+\epsilon) \}
$$


is open in $\mathbb{R}^2$, as addition is continuous. Thus, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open.


For $\cdot: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, the same argument applies: given open $U$, around any $(a, b)$ we take $\epsilon > 0$ such that $(ab-\epsilon, ab+\epsilon) \subseteq U$, and  

$$
W = \{(x, y) \mid xy \in (ab-\epsilon, ab+\epsilon) \}
$$

is open in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Hence, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open, proving continuity.

# 4.
Give an example of a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that is continuous when the domain and codomain both have the usual topology, but not continuous when they both have the ray topology or the Sorgenfrey/lower limit topology.

  In the usual topology, $f(x) = -x$ is continuous because negation is just a polynomial.
  
 In the ray topology, the basis sets are of the form $(a, \infty)$. The preimage of $(a, \infty)$ under $f(x) = -x$ is $f^{-1}((a, \infty)) = (-\infty, -a)$, which is not open in the ray topology because the ray topology requires sets of the form $(b, \infty)$, and $(-\infty, -a)$ does not fit that form. 

Therefore, $f(x) = -x$ is not continuous in the ray topology, showing that negation can break continuity in the ray topology.

For $f(x) = -x$, in the \textbf{Sorgenfrey topology}, the preimage of $[a, b)$ is $[-b, -a)$, which is not open because it's not of the form $[c, d)$. Hence, $f(x) = -x$ is not continuous in the Sorgenfrey topology.

# 5.
Prove that all the properties in Proposition 6.2 in the lecture notes on continuous functions are indeed topological invariants.

  Soln.
  For $T_0$: If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic with $f: X \to Y$, and $X$ is $T_0$, for distinct $x_1, x_2 \in X$, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x_1 \in U$ and $x_2 \notin U$. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, $f(U)$ is open in $Y$, and $f(x_1) \in f(U)$, $f(x_2) \notin f(U)$. Thus, $Y$ is T0. The reverse follows similarly. So, T0 is invariant under homeomorphisms.

For $T_1$: If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic with $f: X \to Y$, and $X$ is T1, for distinct $x_1, x_2 \in X$, there are open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ such that $x_1 \in U_1$, $x_2 \notin U_1$, and $x_2 \in U_2$, $x_1 \notin U_2$. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, $f(U_1)$ and $f(U_2)$ are open in $Y$ and satisfy the same property for $f(x_1), f(x_2)$. Thus, $Y$ is T1. The reverse follows similarly. So, T1 is invariant under homeomorphisms.

For T2 (Hausdorff): If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic via $f: X \to Y$, then $f$ is bijective. Given distinct $x_1, x_2 \in X$, their images $f(x_1), f(x_2) \in Y$ are distinct. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $U_1, U_2 \subset X$ such that $x_1 \in U_1$ and $x_2 \in U_2$. Then $f(U_1)$ and $f(U_2)$ are disjoint open sets in $Y$ containing $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, respectively, making $Y$ Hausdorff. The reverse follows similarly

For separability: If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic via $f: X \to Y$, and $X$ has a countable dense subset $D \subset X$, then $f(D) \subset Y$ is countable since $f$ is bijective. For any nonempty open set $V \subset Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$ and intersects $D$, so $V$ intersects $f(D)$. Hence, $f(D)$ is dense in $Y$, making $Y$ separable. The reverse follows similarly, so separability is invariant under homeomorphisms.

since homeomorphisms are bijections, they preserve cardinality. If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic, there is a bijection $f: X \to Y$, meaning $|X| = |Y|$. Thus, if $X$ is countable (or uncountable), so is $Y$. Hence, cardinality is a topological invariant.

For first-countability: If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic via $f: X \to Y$, then for any $x \in X$, a countable local basis $\{U_n\}$ at $x$ gives a countable local basis $\{f(U_n)\}$ at $f(x)$ in $Y$, preserving first-countability. The reverse follows similarly, so first-countability is a topological invariant.  

For second-countability: If $X$ has a countable basis $\mathcal{B}$, then $\{f(B) \mid B \in \mathcal{B}\}$ is a countable basis for $Y$ since $f$ is bijective and open. The reverse holds similarly, so second-countability is invariant under homeomorphisms.

also keep in mind first countability iff second countability

For the chain condition (any version like **CCC, LCC, or SCCC**): If $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic via $f: X \to Y$, then any collection of open sets in $X$ satisfying the given chain condition maps bijectively to a collection in $Y$ with the same property, since $f$ preserves inclusion and openness. The reverse follows similarly, so any chain condition is invariant under homeomorphisms.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces, let $D \subseteq X$ be dense in $X$, and suppose $f : X \to Y$ is continuous and surjective. Show that $f(D) = \{ f(d) \in Y : d \in D \}$ is dense in $Y$. Conclude that a surjective, continuous image of a separable space is separable.

Soln.

  Let $V \subseteq Y$ be an arbitrary non-empty open set. Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$, and since $f$ is surjective, $f^{-1}(V) \neq \varnothing$. Now $D$ is dense in $X$, so $f^{-1}(V) \cap D \neq \varnothing$. Pick $d \in f^{-1}(V) \cap D$, then $f(d) \in V$ and $d \in D$, so $f(d) \in f(D) \cap V$. Therefore every non-empty open set $V$ intersects $f(D)$, so $f(D)$ is dense in $Y$.

Assume $f(D)$ is not dense in $Y$. Then there exists a non-empty open set $V \subseteq Y$ such that $V \cap f(D) = \varnothing$. Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. Now, $f(D) \cap V = \varnothing$ means that $f^{-1}(V) \cap D = \varnothing$, because if some $d \in D$ were in $f^{-1}(V)$, then $f(d) \in V$ — contradiction.

So we have $f^{-1}(V) \cap D = \varnothing$. But $D$ is dense in $X$, so every non-empty open set in $X$ must intersect $D$. Thus $f^{-1}(V)$ must be empty — contradiction again, since $f$ is surjective and $V$ is non-empty, so $f^{-1}(V) \ne \varnothing$.
Contradiction $\rightarrow f(D)$ must be dense in $Y$.

Since $X$ is separable, it has a countable dense subset $D \subseteq X$. By continuity and surjectivity of $f : X \to Y$, we’ve shown that $f(D)$ is dense in $Y$. Also, since $D$ is countable and $f$ maps into $Y$, $f(D)$ is at most countable.
So $Y$ has a countable dense subset $\rightarrow Y$ is separable.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces, and suppose that $f : X \to Y$ is a bijection. Show that the following are equivalent:

   (a) $f^{-1}$ is continuous.

   (b) $f$ is open.

   (c) $f$ is closed.
    
  (The equivalence between (b) and (c) is Proposition 4.3 in the lecture notes on continuous functions. Again, these proofs should be immediate from the definitions and some elementary properties of functions and sets. If you find yourself having to get creative, you are overthinking.)
  
  Since $f$ is a bijection, continuity of $f^{-1}$ means that for any open set $V \subset Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. But this is exactly the definition of $f$ being an **open map**.
  
 Similarly, if $f$ is closed, then for any closed set $C \subset X$, $f(C)$ is closed in $Y$, which is equivalent to $f^{-1}$ preserving openness when applied to complements.
  
  Hence, (a) $\iff$ (b) $\iff$ (c).

Characterize the continuous functions from $\mathbb{R}_{co-countable}$ to $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$, and from $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_7)$ to $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ (recall that $\mathcal{T}_7$ is the particular point topology at 7).




In $\mathbb{R}_{\text{usual}}$, singleton sets are closed, meaning their preimages must also be closed, so $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ must be either co-countable or empty. **which then forces $f$ to be constant**, since otherwise, different preimages would form a separation of $\mathbb{R}$, contradicting the hypothesis(the nature of topology). Hence, the only continuous functions are constant functions.

   Given that $U = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{f(7)\}$ is open in the usual topology, its preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ must be open in $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{T}_7}$. But in $\mathcal{T}_7$, the only open sets are either $\emptyset$ or sets containing $7$.
   
   **Since $f^{-1}(U)$ does not contain $7$**, it must be $\emptyset$, meaning no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ maps to any point other than $f(7)$. This forces $f$ to be constant.

# 9.
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces and let $f : X \to Y$.

   (a) Suppose $f$ is continuous, and $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence in $X$ converging to a point $x$. Show that $\{f(x_n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges to $f(x)$.

   Suppose $f$ preserves limits of sequences but is not continuous at $x$. Then there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that for all $\delta>0$ there exists a point $y$ with $d_X(x,y)<\delta$ but $d_Y(f(x),f(y))>\varepsilon$. Then we construct a sequence of $\delta_i$ tending to 0, and select $y_i$ so that where $d_X(x,y_i)<\delta_i$. Then this sequence tends to $x$ but its image does not tend to $f(x)$.
   
   Conversely, suppose $f$ is continuous, and let $x_n$ tend to $x$. Fix any $\varepsilon>0$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists a ball of radius $\delta$ such that $d_X(x,y)<\delta$ implies $d_Y(f(x),f(y))<\varepsilon$. Then since the $x_n$ are eventually all within the $\delta$-ball centered at $x$, their images are eventually all in the $\epsilon$-ball centered at $f(x)$. Thus $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(x)$.
   
   
  $$
\displaystyle\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f(x_n)=f(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n)
$$
  
   
   (b) Suppose $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is first countable, and suppose for each $x \in X$ and each sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ that converges to $x$, $\{f(x_n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges to $f(x)$. Show that $f$ is continuous.

  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be first countable, and $f: X \to Y$ such that if $x_n \to x$, then $f(x_n) \to f(x)$.
  
Assume, for contradiction, $f$ is discontinuous at $x$. Then there's an open $V \ni f(x)$ such that for every open $U \ni x$, $f(U) \not\subseteq V$.

Let $\{B_n\}$ be a countable local base at $x$. For each $n$, there's $x_n \in B_n$ with $f(x_n) \notin V$. Since $\{B_n\}$ is a local base, $x_n \to x$. By assumption, $f(x_n) \to f(x)$. But $f(x_n) \notin V$ for all $n$, contradicting $f(x_n) \to f(x) \in V$. Thus, $f$ is continuous.

# 10.
Let $f : \mathbb{R}_{usual} \to \mathbb{R}_{usual}$ be continuous. Let $g : \mathbb{R}_{usual} \to \mathbb{R}^2_{usual}$ be defined by $g(x) = (x, f(x))$. Show that $g$ is continuous.

Soln.
Let $x_n \to x$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is continuous, $f(x_n) \to f(x)$.  Thus, $(x_n, f(x_n)) \to (x, f(x))$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, meaning $g(x_n) \to g(x)$.

Let $U$ be open in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $g(x) = (x, f(x)) \in U$.  Since $\mathbb{R}^2$ has the product topology, there exist open sets $V_1, V_2$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $(x, f(x)) \in V_1 \times V_2 \subseteq U$.

Since $x_n \to x$, there's $N_1$ such that $x_n \in V_1$ for $n \geq N_1$. Since $f(x_n) \to f(x)$, there's $N_2$ such that $f(x_n) \in V_2$ for $n \geq N_2$.

Let $N = \max\{N_1, N_2\}$. Then for $n \geq N$, $(x_n, f(x_n)) \in V_1 \times V_2 \subseteq U$. Thus, $g(x_n) \to g(x)$, so $g$ is continuous.


**Since $\mathbb{R}$ is first countable, sequential continuity implies continuity.**

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, $g(x) = (x, f(x))$.

  If $x_n \to x$, then $f(x_n) \to f(x)$ by continuity of $f$. Thus $(x_n, f(x_n)) \to (x, f(x))$, so $g(x_n) \to g(x)$. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is first countable, $g$ is continuous.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and let $f, g : X \to \mathbb{R}_{usual}$ be continuous functions. Prove that $f + g$ (i.e., $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$) is continuous. Do the same for $f(x)g(x)$.

  Define $h: X \to \mathbb{R}^2$ by $h(x) = (f(x), g(x))$. Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous, $h$ is continuous as a map into $\mathbb{R}^2_{\text{usual}}$.

 Now, construct continuous maps $s, p:\mathbb{R}^2_{\text{usual}} \to \mathbb{R}_{\text{usual}}$ given by $s(x, y) = x + y$ and $p(x, y) = xy$. Since $f+g = s \circ h$ and $fg = p \circ h$, and compositions of continuous maps are continuous, it follows that $f+g$ and $fg$ are continuous.

# 12.
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be a Hausdorff topological space. Let $A \subseteq X$ be a nonempty subset. Suppose $f, g : X \to Y$ are continuous functions that agree on all points of $A$ (i.e., $f(a) = g(a)$ for all $a \in A$). Show that they must agree on all points of $\overline{A}$.

Let $f, g: X \to Y$ be continuous functions, where $Y$ is Hausdorff. Define $h: X \to Y$ by $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. whence so $\{y \in Y : y = 0\}$ is closed.

  Given $f|_A = g|_A$ for some $A \subseteq X$, we have $h(a) = 0$ for all $a \in A$, so $A \subseteq h^{-1}(\{0\})$. Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, $\{0\}$ is closed in $Y$. Because $h$ is continuous, $h^{-1}(\{0\})$ is closed in $X$. Thus, $\bar{A} \subseteq h^{-1}(\{0\})$, which implies $h(x) = 0$ for all $x \in \bar{A}$. Therefore, $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in \bar{A}$, so $f|_{\bar{A}} = g|_{\bar{A}}$.
  
   Conclude that $A_{f,g} := \{ x \in X : f(x) = g(x) \}$ is closed.

   Also conclude that if $f, g : X \to Y$ are continuous functions, $D \subseteq X$ is dense, $Y$ is Hausdorff, and $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \in D$, then $f = g$.

  

# 13.
Show that $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2_{usual}$ are not homeomorphic.

  
Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$ be a homeomorphism. For each $x\in \mathbb{R}$, define $f_x:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ as $f_x(y)=f(x,y)$. We have the following easy observations.

(1) $f_x$ is a continuous 1-1 map,

(2) range of $f_x$ is a non-trivial (open) interval,

(3) if $x_1\neq x_2$, then the range of $f_{x_1}$ and the range of $f_{x_2}$ are disjoint.

Thus we have got an uncountable number (corresponding to each $x\in \mathbb{R}$) of pairwise disjoint open intervals (range of each function $f_x$) in $\mathbb{R}$. This contradicts separability of $\mathbb{R}$, since $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable dense set, for example $\mathbb{Q}$.

Fact: In a separable topological space, there does not exist an uncountable number of pairwise disjoint non-empty open sets. If such a collection exists, then any dense set will have to meet each member of the collection and would demand the cardinality of a dense set to be uncountable (by pigeon-hole principle).


# 14.
Show that $\mathbb{R}^n_{usual}$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^m_{usual}$ for any $n \neq m$ where $n, m > 1$.

At this point in the course I do not expect anyone in the course to be able to solve this problem without substantial creativity. As with some previous problems of this difficulty, I would like you to spend some time think about it. In particular, if you asked someone who cared about vector space structure (we do not care about that in this course) this question, they would say “the two spaces have different dimensions, so they cannot be isomorphic as vector spaces”. This is because “having dimension n” is an invariant property of vector spaces.                                                                        

The natural question is then whether there is a topological notion of dimension. This is an interesting question, because topological spaces are much more interesting than vector spaces (particularly than finite-dimensional vector spaces). There are a few such notions, but defining them is quite tricky. It seems obvious that R n usual should have dimension n, but what about other topologies on the reals? Do Rusual and the Sorgenfrey Line feel they should have the same dimension? What about Rusual and Q? These are hard questions, and should give you some feeling for how much work it takes to define a topological notion of dimension.
