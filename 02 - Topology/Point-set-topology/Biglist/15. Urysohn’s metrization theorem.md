Recall that a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called completely regular if every $x \in X$ and every closed set $C \subseteq X$ not containing $x$ can be separated by a continuous function. $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is said to be T3.5 if it is completely regular and T1.
Examine the proof of Urysohn’s Lemma and determine why we can’t do a similar proof to show that every regular space is completely regular.

Carefully examine the first proof of Urysohn’s metrization theorem from the notes, and convince yourself that we actually proved this slightly more general fact:
Let $X$ be a T1 topological space. Let $I$ be some indexing set, and suppose there is a family $\{ f_\alpha : X \to [0, 1] : \alpha \in I \}$ of continuous functions such that for each $a \in X$ and each open set $U$ containing $a$, there is an $\alpha \in I$ such that $f_\alpha(a) > 0$ and $f_\alpha(x) = 0$ for all $x \in X \setminus U$.
Then the function $F : X \to [0, 1]^I$ defined by
$$F(x) = g_x : I \to [0, 1], \text{ where } g_x(\alpha) = f_\alpha(x),$$
is an embedding of $X$ into $[0, 1]^I$.

Here is the big payoff. This is a powerful embedding theorem (actually a full characterization) for completely regular spaces, and one of the reasons completely regular spaces are so beloved by topologists.

Theorem 15.1. A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is T3.5 if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of $[0, 1]^I$ for some indexing set $I$.
Prove this theorem.
