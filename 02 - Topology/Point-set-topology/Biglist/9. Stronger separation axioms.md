Show that a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is regular if and only if for every point $x \in X$ and every open set $U$ containing $x$, there is an open set $V$ such that $x \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$.

  ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is normal. Let $U$ be open and $C \subseteq U$ be closed. Then $F = X \setminus U$ is closed and disjoint from $C$. By normality, there exist disjoint open sets $V, W$ such that $C \subseteq V$ and $F \subseteq W$. Thus, $V \subseteq X \setminus W \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$, as required.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose the given condition holds. Let $C, D$ be disjoint closed sets. Taking $U = X \setminus D$, we obtain an open $V$ such that $C \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$, so $\overline{V}$ and $D$ are disjoint. Since $D$ is closed, $W = X \setminus \overline{V}$ is open and contains $D$, proving normality.

Prove that regularity is a topological invariant.

  Let $f: (X, \mathcal{T}) \to (Y, \mathcal{T}')$ be a homeomorphism, and suppose $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is regular.
  
  Let $y \in Y$ and $F \subseteq Y$ be closed with $y \notin F$. Then $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$, and $f^{-1}(y)$ is a point not in $f^{-1}(F)$. By regularity of $X$, there exist disjoint open sets $V, W$ in $X$ such that $f^{-1}(y) \in V$ and $f^{-1}(F) \subseteq W$. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, $f(V)$ and $f(W)$ are disjoint open sets in $Y$ with $y \in f(V)$ and $F \subseteq f(W)$, proving that $Y$ is regular.

# 4. 
Prove that regularity is finitely productive.

  Let $(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)$ be regular spaces for $i = 1, 2$.\\

Take $(x_1, x_2) \in X_1 \times X_2$ and an open set $U$ containing $(x_1, x_2)$. There exists a basis element $U_1 \times U_2$ such that $(x_1, x_2) \in U_1 \times U_2 \subseteq U$. Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are regular, there exist open sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that
$$x_1 \in V_1 \subseteq \overline{V_1} \subseteq U_1, \quad x_2 \in V_2 \subseteq \overline{V_2} \subseteq U_2$$
Setting $V = V_1 \times V_2$, we get
$$(x_1, x_2) \in V \subseteq \overline{V_1} \times \overline{V_2} \subseteq U_1 \times U_2 \subseteq U$$
Since $\overline{V_1} \times \overline{V_2} = \overline{V_1 \times V_2} = \overline{V}$, we have
$(x_1, x_2) \in V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$.
Thus, $X_1 \times X_2$ is regular. By induction we can show it for finite $n \in \mathbb{N}$

Prove that normality is a topological invariant.

  Let $f: (X, \mathcal{T}) \to (Y, \mathcal{T}')$ be a homeomorphism, and suppose $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is normal. Let $C, D$ be disjoint closed sets in $Y$. Then $f^{-1}(C)$ and $f^{-1}(D)$ are disjoint closed sets in $X$. By normality of $X$, there exist disjoint open sets $V, W$ in $X$ such that $f^{-1}(C) \subseteq V$ and $f^{-1}(D) \subseteq W$. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, $f(V)$ and $f(W)$ are disjoint open sets in $Y$ with $C \subseteq f(V)$ and $D \subseteq f(W)$, proving that $Y$ is normal. 

# 6.
Prove that every closed subspace of a normal topological space is normal.

## normality is not hereditary, however
  
Suppose $A, B$ are disjoint closed sets in the Sorgenfrey line. We have to find open sets $U, V$ such that $A \subseteq U, B \subseteq V,$ and $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

For each $a \in A$, choose $a' > a$ such that $[a, a') \cap B = \emptyset$; then $U = \bigcup_{a \in A} [a, a')$ is an open set containing $A$.

For each $b \in B$, choose $b' > b$ such that $[b, b') \cap A = \emptyset$; then $V = \bigcup_{b \in B} [b, b')$ is an open set containing $B$.

To show that $U \cap V = \emptyset$, it suffices to show that $[a, a') \cap [b, b') = \emptyset$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$. Suppose $a \in A, b \in B$, and assume without loss of generality that $a < b$. Since $[a, a') \cap B = \emptyset$, it follows that $b \geq a'$, and so $[a, a') \cap [b, b') = \emptyset$.

# 7. 
Show that $\mathbb{R}_{Sorgenfrey}$ is normal.


Let $A, B \subset \mathbb{R}$ be disjoint closed sets in the Sorgenfrey topology. Since the Sorgenfrey line is a $T_{1}$ space and regular, to show it's normal, we construct disjoint open sets $U \supset A$ and $V \supset B$.

For each $a \in A$, since $B$ is closed and disjoint from $a$, there exists $\epsilon_a > 0$ such that $[a, a + \epsilon_a) \cap B = \emptyset$. Let $U = \bigcup_{a \in A} [a, a + \epsilon_a)$. Similarly, for each $b \in B$, choose $\delta_b > 0$ such that $[b, b + \delta_b) \cap A = \emptyset$ and define $V = \bigcup_{b \in B} [b, b + \delta_b)$.

Two disjoint subsets $A, B \subseteq X$ can be separated by continuous functions if there exists a continuous $f : X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in A$ and $f(y) = 1$ for all $y \in B$.

• $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is completely regular if every $x \in X$ and every closed set $C \subseteq X$ not containing $x$ can be separated by a continuous function. $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is $T_{3.5}$ (Tychonoff space) if it is completely regular and $T_1$.

  

# Theorem 9.4.
(Urysohn’s Lemma). A topological space is normal if and only if every pair of disjoint, nonempty closed sets can be separated by a continuous function.

  

# Definition 9.5.

• Two subsets $A$ and $B$ of $X$ are called separated if $\overline{A} \cap B = A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset$.

• $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is completely normal if whenever $A$ and $B$ are separated subsets of $X$, then there are disjoint open subsets $U$ and $V$ of $X$ such that $A \subseteq U$ and $B \subseteq V$. A T1 completely normal space is T5.

• $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is perfectly normal if whenever $C$ and $D$ are disjoint, nonempty, closed subsets of $X$, there exists a continuous function $f : X \to [0, 1]$ such that $C = f^{-1}(0)$ and $D = f^{-1}(1)$. A T1 perfectly normal space is T6.

# 8.
Show that every completely regular space is regular.

  Let $X$ be a completely regular space. That means for every $x \in X$ and every closed set $C \subseteq X$ with $x \notin C$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that
$$f(x) = 0, \quad f(C) = \{1\}.$$
To show that $X$ is regular, we need to prove that for any $x \in X$ and any closed set $C$ with $x \notin C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $C \subseteq V$.\\

Define $U = f^{-1}([0, 1/2))$ and $V = f^{-1}((1/2, 1])$. These are open because $f$ is continuous, they are disjoint since their intervals are disjoint, and they satisfy $x \in U$, $C \subseteq V$, proving regularity.

$$f(x) = 0, \quad f(C) = \{1\}.$$
To show that $X$ is regular, we need to prove that for any $x \in X$ and any closed set $C$ with $x \notin C$, there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x \in U$ and $C \subseteq V$.\\

Define $U = f^{-1}([0, 1/2))$ and $V = f^{-1}((1/2, 1])$. These are open because $f$ is continuous, they are disjoint since their intervals are disjoint, and they satisfy $x \in U$, $C \subseteq V$, proving regularity.

# 13.
Show that complete regularity is hereditary, and finitely productive.

  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a completely regular space, and let $Y \subseteq X$ be given the subspace topology\\

Take any $y \in Y$ and a closed set $D \subseteq Y$ with $y \notin D$. Since $D$ is closed in $Y$, we can write it as $D = C \cap Y$ for some closed $C \subseteq X$.\\

By complete regularity of $X$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f(y) = 0$ and $f(C) = \{1\}$. Since $f$ is continuous in $X$, its restriction $f|_Y: Y \to [0, 1]$ remains continuous. This function separates $y$ and $D$ in $Y$, proving that $Y$ is completely regular.

Given an embedding $i: Y \hookrightarrow X$, we have a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ that separates $y$ and $C$. Then, the composition
$$Y \xrightarrow{i} X \xrightarrow{f} [0, 1]$$
yields a continuous function $f \circ i: Y \to [0, 1]$ that separates $y$ and $D$.

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be completely regular spaces, and consider $X_1 \times X_2$ with the product topology.

Take any $(x_1, x_2) \in X_1 \times X_2$ and a closed set $C \subseteq X_1 \times X_2$ not containing $(x_1, x_2)$. Then, for each $i$, the projection $p_i(C)$ is closed in $X_i$, and since $(x_1, x_2) \notin C$, we can find continuous functions
$$f_1: X_1 \to [0, 1], \quad f_2: X_2 \to [0, 1]$$
such that $f_1(x_1) = 0$, $f_1(p_1(C)) = \{1\}$ and similarly for $f_2$.

Define $F: X_1 \times X_2 \to [0, 1]$ by
$$F(x_1, x_2) = \max(f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2)).$$
Then $F$ is continuous, $F(x_1, x_2) = 0$, and $F(C) = \{1\}$, proving that $X_1 \times X_2$ is completely regular.

Define continuous functions $f_1: X_1 \to [0, 1]$ and $f_2: X_2 \to [0, 1]$. The function
$$F(x_1, x_2) = \max(f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2))$$
is obtained as
$$X_1 \times X_2 \xrightarrow{(f_1, f_2)} [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \xrightarrow{\max} [0, 1].$$
This ensures separation in the product space.

# 14.
Show that a topological space is completely normal if and only if it is hereditarily normal.

  Let $X$ be completely normal. Take any subspace $Y \subseteq X$. We show $Y$ is normal.

Let $A, B$ be disjoint closed subsets of $Y$. Then, their closures in $X$, denoted $\overline{A}^X$ and $\overline{B}^X$, are disjoint in $X$. Since $X$ is completely normal, there exist disjoint open sets $U, V \subseteq X$ such that
$$
\overline{A}^X \subset U, \quad \overline{B}^X \subset V.
$$
Now, $U' = U \cap Y$ and $V' = V \cap Y$ are open in the subspace topology, and
$$
A \subset U', \quad B \subset V', \quad U' \cap V' = \emptyset.
$$
Thus, $Y$ is normal, proving $X$ is hereditarily normal.


Let $A, B \subseteq X$ be separated subsets, meaning
$$\overline{A} \cap B = A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset.$$
Since $X$ is hereditarily normal, every subspace of $X$ is normal. In particular, the subspace
$$S = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$$
is a normal space (as it is a subspace of $X$).

Now, in the normal space $S$, the closed sets $\overline{A}$ and $\overline{B}$ are disjoint, so by normality of $S$, there exist disjoint open sets $U', V' \subseteq S$ such that
$$\overline{A} \subset U', \quad \overline{B} \subset V'.$$
Since $U', V'$ are open in $S$, their preimages in $X$, say
$$U = \text{int}_X(U'), \quad V = \text{int}_X(V'),$$
are open in $X$ and still satisfy $A \subset U$, $B \subset V$, and $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

Thus, $A$ and $B$ are separated by disjoint open sets in $X$, proving $X$ is completely normal.

We explicitly applied hereditary normality to conclude that the subspace $S = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$ is normal, allowing us to separate $\overline{A}$ and $\overline{B}$. This step is what distinguishes this proof from a normality-based argument.


# 15. 
 Two very useful ways of characterizing perfect normality are given by the following theo-
rem. For now, you may assume this theorem without proof.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. Then the following are equivalent.

(a) $X$ is perfectly normal: Whenever $C$ and $D$ are disjoint, nonempty, closed subsets of $X$, there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $C = f^{-1}(0)$ and $D = f^{-1}(1)$.

 (b) For every closed $C \subseteq X$, there is a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $C = f^{-1}(0)$. (We would refer to this property by saying “every closed set is a zero set”.)
 
 (c) $X$ is normal, and every closed subset of $X$ is $G_\delta$. (Recall that a subset of a topological space is called $G_\delta$ if it is equal to a countable intersection of open sets.)

  **Using this theorem, show that the property of being perfectly normal is hereditary, and**
**conclude from the previous exercise that every perfectly normal space is completely normal**.


# 16.
From the previous exercises in this and an earlier section, conclude that

    $T_6 \implies T_5 \implies T_4 \implies T_{3.5} \implies T_3 \implies T_{2.5} \implies T_2 \implies T_1 \implies T_0$

  

# 17.
Prove the equivalence between (a) and (b) of Theorem 9.6.

   Prove that a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is perfectly normal if and only if it is normal and every closed subset of $X$ is $G_\delta$.

  

# 18.
Construct a topological space to show that $T_2$ $\not\implies$ $T_{2.5}$.(Hint: Try some ideas similar to the Furstenburg topology.)

  It is  also true that $T_{2.5}$ $\not\implies$ $T_3$, though the example is not something anyone could reasonably come up with. Take a look at Example 78 in *Counterexamples in Topology* for more information.
