  Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{B}$ a basis for $\mathcal{T}$. Let $A \subseteq X$. Show that $x \in \overline{A}$ if for every basic open set $U$ containing $x$, $U \cap A \neq \emptyset$.

Soln.
Let $x \in X$. By definition, $x \in \overline{A}$ if every open set $U \ni x$ satisfies $U \cap A \ne \emptyset$. Since every open set is a union of basis elements, it's enough that every basic open set $B \ni x$ intersects $A$. Hence,
$$x \in \overline{A} \iff \forall B \in \mathcal{B},\, x \in B \Rightarrow B \cap A \ne \emptyset.$$

# 2. 
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and $A, B \subseteq X$. Show that $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$. Is it true that $\overline{A \cap B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$? Prove it or give a counterexample.

Soln.
We always have $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$, since closure distributes over finite unions. So, we can go upto finite sum of open sets here

But $\overline{A \cap B} \subseteq \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$ in general, and equality may fail.
Counterexample: Let $X = \mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology,
$A = (0,1)$, $B = (1,2)$. Then:
$A \cap B = \emptyset \Rightarrow \overline{A \cap B} = \emptyset$
But $\overline{A} = [0,1]$, $\overline{B} = [1,2] \Rightarrow \overline{A} \cap \overline{B} = \{1\}$
So,
$$\overline{A \cap B} \ne \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}.$$
# 3.
Let $A = \{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$, prove that $\overline{A} = A \cup \{0\}$.

Soln.
Any point $x \in A$ is in $\overline{A}$ since closures contain all the points of the set.
Now take $x = 0$. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \varepsilon$, hence $(0,\varepsilon)$ intersects $A$. So $0$ is a limit point of $A$ and must be in $\overline{A}$.
For any $x < 0$ or $x > 1$, there exists an open neighborhood disjoint from $A$, so such $x$ are not in $\overline{A}$.

**to be mindful here we are working with the R_usual inherited so basically the subspace topology**

Prove Proposition 3.4 from the lecture notes on Closures. That is, if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is a topological space and $A \subseteq X$, show that
  $$\overline{A} = \bigcap \{ C \subseteq X : C \text{ is closed, and } A \subseteq C \} .$$
Soln.
Observe that any open set $V$ disjoint from $A$ must lie entirely within the complement of the closure, i.e., $V \subseteq \overline{A}^c$. This is because the closure contains all limit points of $A$, and $V$ contains none. Thus, $\overline{A}^c$ is the union of all open sets disjoint from $A$, making it the largest such open set, and hence $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$.

# 6.
Prove Proposition 4.2 from the lecture notes on Closures. That is, if $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and $D \subseteq X$, show that $D$ is dense if and only if for every nonempty open set $U \subseteq X$, $D \cap U \neq \emptyset$.

Soln.
By definition, $D$ is dense in $X$ if $\overline{D} = X$. But $\overline{D}$ is the set of all $x \in X$ such that every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $D$. So $\overline{D} = X$ if and only if for every nonempty open set $U \subseteq X$, we have $U \cap D \ne \emptyset$. Hence, $D$ is dense if and only if $D$ intersects every nonempty open set.

---
# 7.
In an arbitrary topological space, is the union of two dense sets necessarily dense? What about the intersection of two dense sets? For both questions, prove it or give a counterexample.

Soln.

**Union:** Yes.

If $A$ and $B$ are dense in $X$, then $\overline{A} = X$ and $\overline{B} = X$. So for every nonempty open $U \subseteq X$, $U \cap A \ne \emptyset$ and $U \cap B \ne \emptyset$, hence $U \cap (A \cup B) \ne \emptyset$. Therefore, $\overline{A \cup B} = X$.

**Intersection:** Not necessarily dense.

Let $A = \mathbb{Q}$ and $B = \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}_{\text{usual}}$. Both are dense, but $A \cap B = \emptyset$, which is not dense. So the intersection of dense sets need not be dense.

For some of the exercises in this section, we are going to need a new definition. This definition is dual to the definition of closure in some sense, though it will not be quite as useful for us.

Definition 3.1. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $A \subseteq X$. We define the interior of $A$ in $(X, \mathcal{T})$, denoted $\operatorname{int}(A)$, by:
$$x \in \operatorname{int}(A) \text{ if and only if there is an open set } U \text{ containing } x \text{ such that } U \subseteq A.$$
# 8.
Show for any topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and any $A \subseteq X$, that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open.

  

   Let $y \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. By the definition of the interior, there exists an open set $V$ such that $y \in V$ and $V \subseteq A$. We want to show that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open, which means that for every point $y$ in $\operatorname{int}(A)$, there exists an open set $W$ containing $y$ such that $W \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   Consider the open set $V$ that contains $y$ and is a subset of $A$. We claim that $V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$. Let $z \in V$. Since $V$ is open and $z \in V$, $V$ is an open set containing $z$. Furthermore, we know that $V \subseteq A$. Therefore, by the definition of the interior, $z \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. Since this holds for any $z \in V$, we conclude that $V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   Thus, for every $y \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, we have found an open set $V$ (containing $y$) such that $V \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$. This shows that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open.

  

# 9.
Going further than the previous exercise, show that

    $$\operatorname{int}(A) = \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \} .$$

   Many texts will take the equation above as the definition of the interior of a set.

  

   Let $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. By definition, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x \in U$ and $U \subseteq A$. This open set $U$ is one of the sets in the union on the right-hand side. Therefore, $x$ is an element of the union. This shows that $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \}$.

  

   Conversely, let $x \in \bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \}$. Then there exists at least one open set $V$ such that $x \in V$ and $V \subseteq A$. By the definition of the interior, this means that $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. This shows that $\bigcup \{U \subseteq X : U \text{ is open, and } U \subseteq A \} \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.
    


# 10.
Show that a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $A$ is open. For every $x \in A$, $A$ itself is an open set containing $x$ such that $A \subseteq A$. By the definition of the interior, $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. Therefore, $A \subseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$.

   From the definition of the interior, $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is a union of open sets contained in $A$, so $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$.

   Thus, if $A$ is open, then $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  

   ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$. From Exercise 8, we know that $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is open. Since $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$, it follows that $A$ is open.

  

   Therefore, a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is open if and only if $A = \operatorname{int}(A)$.

Another new definition, intimately connected to interiors and closures.

Definition 3.2. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and let $A \subseteq X$. We define the boundary of $A$ in $(X, \mathcal{T})$, denoted $\partial(A)$, by

$$x \in \partial(A) \text{ if and only if for every open set } U \text{ containing } x, U \cap A \neq \emptyset \text{ and } U \cap (X \setminus A) \neq \emptyset.$$

Intuitively, these are the points that are close to both $A$ and its complement.

# 12.
Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Show that $\partial(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A} = \overline{A} \setminus \operatorname{int}(A)$.

  
**First Inclusion:**
Let $x \in \operatorname{Int}(A)$.
Then there exists an open set $U$ such that $x \in U \subset A$.
This implies $U \cap (X \setminus A) = \emptyset$.
Since $U$ is an open set disjoint from $X \setminus A$, it must be disjoint from its closure $\overline{X \setminus A}$. That is, $U \cap \overline{X \setminus A} = \emptyset$.
Since $x \in U$, it follows that $x \notin \overline{X \setminus A}$.
Therefore, $x \in X \setminus \overline{X \setminus A}$.
Thus,
$$\operatorname{Int}(A) \subseteq X \setminus \overline{X \setminus A}.$$

**Reverse Inclusion:**
Let $x \in X \setminus \overline{X \setminus A}$.
This means $x \notin \overline{X \setminus A}$.
By the definition of closure, if $x$ is not in $\overline{X \setminus A}$, then there must exist an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \cap (X \setminus A) = \emptyset$.
Since $U \cap (X \setminus A) = \emptyset$, it means that $U$ is entirely contained in $A$, i.e., $U \subseteq A$.
Since $x \in U$ and $U$ is an open set contained in $A$, by definition, $x \in \operatorname{Int}(A)$.
Therefore,
$$X \setminus \overline{X \setminus A} \subseteq \operatorname{Int}(A).$$
---

$$
x \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset A \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \notin X \setminus A \subset \overline{X \setminus A} \quad \Rightarrow \quad  x \notin \overline{X \setminus A}
$$
$$
x \in X\setminus \overline{X \setminus A} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset X \setminus \overline{X \setminus A}
$$

# 13.
Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Show that $\overline{A} = A \cup \partial(A)$ and $\operatorname{int}(A) = A \setminus \partial(A)$.

  Let $x \in \overline{A}$. Then either $x \in A$, or $x$ is a limit point of $A$, i.e., every open set around $x$ intersects $A \setminus \{x\}$. If $x$ is a limit point but $x \notin A$, then every open set around $x$ intersects $A$ and $X \setminus A$ (since $x \in X \setminus A$), so $x \in \partial A$. Thus, $\overline{A} \subseteq A \cup \partial A$. Conversely, if $x \in A$, then clearly $x \in \overline{A}$. If $x \in \partial A$, then every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$, so $x \in \overline{A}$. Hence, $\overline{A} = A \cup \partial A$.

Now, let $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. Then some open neighborhood of $x$ is contained entirely in $A$, so it cannot intersect $X \setminus A$, hence $x \notin \partial A$. Therefore, $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A \setminus \partial A$. Conversely, if $x \in A$ and $x \notin \partial A$, then there exists an open neighborhood of $x$ that does not intersect $X \setminus A$. This means this neighborhood is contained entirely in $A$, so $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$. Thus, $\operatorname{int}(A) = A \setminus \partial A$.

# 14.
Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Show that $X = \operatorname{int}(A) \sqcup \partial(A) \sqcup \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$. (The $\sqcup$ is the “disjoint union” symbol.)

  ### Proof:


1.  **Disjointness**:
    * By definition, $\operatorname{int}(A) \cap \partial(A) = \emptyset$ since $\operatorname{int}(A)$ is the largest open set contained in $A$, and $\partial(A)$ means no such open set containing points of $\partial(A)$ lies entirely in $A$ or entirely in $X \setminus A$. More precisely, $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq A$ and $\partial(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}$. If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U \subseteq A$. If $x \in \partial(A)$, then every open neighborhood of $x$ must intersect $X \setminus A$. These are contradictory.
    * Similarly, $\operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$ is disjoint from both $\operatorname{int}(A)$ and $\partial(A)$. The argument for $\operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) \cap \partial(A) = \emptyset$ is symmetric to the one above. For $\operatorname{int}(X \setminus A) \cap \operatorname{int}(A) = \emptyset$, if $x$ was in both, then there would be an open neighborhood of $x$ in $A$ and an open neighborhood of $x$ in $X \setminus A$. Their intersection would be an open neighborhood of $x$ in $A \cap (X \setminus A) = \emptyset$, which is impossible.

2.  **Union**:
    * Let $x \in X$.
    * If $x \in \operatorname{int}(A)$, then $x$ belongs to the first set.
    * If $x \notin \operatorname{int}(A)$, then every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $X \setminus A$.
        * If, in addition, $x \in \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$, then $x$ belongs to the third set.
        * If $x \notin \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$, then every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$.
    * Combining the conditions $x \notin \operatorname{int}(A)$ and $x \notin \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$, we have that every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $X \setminus A$ AND every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$. This is precisely the definition of $x \in \partial(A)$. So $x$ belongs to the second set.

Thus, $X = \operatorname{int}(A) \sqcup \partial(A) \sqcup \operatorname{int}(X \setminus A)$.

# 15.
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is called regular open if $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = A$.

   (a) Show that in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$, any open interval $(a, b)$ is regular open.

(a) Let $A = (a, b)$ be an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology. Then $\overline{A} = [a, b]$ because every point in $[a, b]$ is either in $A$ or a limit point of $A$. Taking interior, $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = (a, b) = A$. So $(a, b)$ is regular open.

---

   (b) Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. Is it true that $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = \operatorname{int}(A)$? If not, is there containment one way or the other?

(b) In general, $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) \supseteq \operatorname{int}(A)$. This is because $A \subseteq \overline{A}$ implies $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A})$. Equality does not always hold. For example, in $\mathbb{R}$, take $A = (0,1) \cup (1,2)$. Then $\overline{A} = [0,2]$ and $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = (0,2)$, but $\operatorname{int}(A) = A$. So the containment is proper.

---

   (c) Show that the intersection of two regular open sets is again regular open (in any topological space).

Let $A$ and $B$ be regular open sets, so $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = A$ and $\operatorname{int}(\overline{B}) = B$. Then
$$ \operatorname{int}(\overline{A \cap B}) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) \cap \operatorname{int}(\overline{B}) = A \cap B.$$
Also, since $A \cap B \subseteq \overline{A \cap B}$, we get
$$ \operatorname{int}(A \cap B) \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A \cap B}). $$
So $A \cap B \subseteq \operatorname{int}(\overline{A \cap B})$, and equality holds. Hence $A \cap B$ is regular open.

   (d) Is the union of two regular open sets again regular open? Prove it or give a counterexample.

in $\mathbb{R}$, take $A = (0,1) \cup (1,2)$. Then $\overline{A} = [0,2]$ and $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = (0,2)$, but $\operatorname{int}(A) = A$.

   (e) Given a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, let $A^c = X \setminus A$. Show that a set $A$ is regular open if and only if $(A^c)^c = A$, where the interior is taken after the complement.
   
Let $A^c$ denote $X \setminus A$. Then $\overline{A} = (A^c)^{\circ c}$ and $\operatorname{int}(\overline{A}) = ((A^c)^{\circ c})^\circ$. So $A = \operatorname{int}(\overline{A})$ becomes $A = ((A^c)^{\circ c})^\circ = ((A^c)^\circ)^c$. Taking complement again, $A^c = (A^c)^\circ$, so $A^c$ is regular closed, and $A$ is regular open iff $(A^c)^\circ = A^c$, i.e., $(A^c)^c = A$.

# 16.
Let $A$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its usual topology. Show that $x \in \overline{A}$ if and only if there exists a sequence of elements of $A$ that converges to $x$.

Suppose $x \in \overline{A}$. Then every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$, so for each $n$, take $x_n \in A \cap B(x, \tfrac{1}{n})$. Then $x_n \to x$ and $x_n \in A$.

Conversely, if $x_n \in A$ and $x_n \to x$, then every neighborhood of $x$ contains some $x_n \in A$, so $x \in \overline{A}$.  

suppose $x\notin \overline A$. Then there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B(x,\varepsilon) \cap A = \varnothing$. If $(x_n)$ is a sequence converging to $x$, then there exists $m\in \mathbb N$ such that $d(x,x_m) < \varepsilon$, and so $x_m \notin A$. So, there is no sequence in $A$ converging to $x$.

# 17.
We have already learned that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology. Is $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ dense? How about if you remove finitely many points from $\mathbb{Q}$? Is there an infinite set of points you can remove from $\mathbb{Q}$ that leaves the resulting set dense?

  Yes, $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ because deleting a single point doesn't affect density---every open interval still contains infinitely many rationals different from 0.
  
More generally, removing finitely many points from $\mathbb{Q}$ leaves it dense, since any open interval contains infinitely many rationals, so some will avoid the deleted set.

Even removing an infinite set like $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ leaves the set dense. For any open interval, most rationals in it are non-integers, so $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$ is still dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

# 18.
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be dense open subsets of $X$. Prove that $D_1 \cap D_2$ is dense and open. Give an example in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ to show that this does not extend even to countably infinite intersections.

 Let $U$ be any nonempty open set. Then $U \cap D_1 \ne \emptyset$ and $U \cap D_2 \ne \emptyset$ (since both are dense), so $U \cap D_1 \cap D_2 \ne \emptyset$. Thus, $D_1 \cap D_2$ intersects every open set and is dense.

Now take $D_n = \mathbb{R} \setminus \left\{ \frac{1}{n} \right\}$, which is open and dense in $\mathbb{R}$. But
$$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty D_n = \mathbb{R} \setminus \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}, $$
which is not dense because, say, the interval $\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{1} \right)$ contains no point of $\mathbb{R} \setminus \left\{ \tfrac{1}{n} \right\}$ and so does not intersect the set. Thus, countable intersections of dense open sets need not be dense.  

Let $X=\mathbb{R}$ and for every $\alpha\in\mathbb{Q}$, define $A_\alpha=\mathbb{R} \setminus\{\alpha\}$

# 19.
Recall the Furstenberg topology $\mathcal{T}_{Furst}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$.

   (a) Show that $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{-1, 1\} = \bigcup_{p \text{ is prime}} \mathbb{Z}(p, 0)$.

By definition, $\mathbb{Z}(p, 0) = \{pz : z \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is the set of all multiples of the prime $p$. Any integer except $-1$ and $1$ is divisible by some prime, so we have
$$ \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{-1, 1\} = \bigcup_{p \text{ prime}} \mathbb{Z}(p, 0). $$

   (b) Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many primes. Deduce from this assumption that $\mathbb{Z} \setminus \{-1, 1\}$ is closed.
   
Suppose there are only finitely many primes $p_1, \dots, p_n$. Then
$$ \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{-1, 1\} = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \mathbb{Z}(p_i, 0). $$
Since each $\mathbb{Z}(p_i, 0)$ is open and closed, the union is closed. Hence, $\{-1, 1\}$ is open as the complement of a closed set.

   (c) Find a contradiction resulting from the previous part, and conclude that there must be infinitely many primes.

But $\{-1, 1\}$ is a finite nonempty set, and no such set can be open in the Furstenberg topology. This contradicts (1). So our assumption that there are only finitely many primes must be false. Thus, there are infinitely many primes.

# 20.
Prove that if $\{ D_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is a collection of dense open subsets of $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$, then $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty D_n$ is dense. Give an example in $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ to show that this result does not extend to arbitrary (i.e., uncountable) intersections.

  Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be any nonempty open set. We want to show that $U \cap \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty D_n \ne \varnothing$. Since $D_1$ is dense and open, $U \cap D_1$ is nonempty and open, so contains some open interval $I_1$. Now $D_2$ is dense, so $I_1 \cap D_2$ is nonempty and open, containing some interval $I_2 \subseteq I_1$. Continue inductively: at step $n$, intersect $I_{n-1}$ with $D_n$ to get a smaller interval $I_n \subseteq I_{n-1} \cap D_n$. Choose $I_n$ to have rational endpoints, so the lengths shrink and the intervals are nested. The intersection $\bigcap I_n$ contains a point $x$ by completeness of $\mathbb{R}$. Since $x \in I_n \subseteq D_n$ for all $n$, we have $x \in \bigcap D_n$, and since $I_1 \subseteq U$, also $x \in U$. Hence $\bigcap D_n$ intersects every nonempty open set, so is dense.
