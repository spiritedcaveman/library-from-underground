  Construct an explicit bijection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ (i.e., give a formula for such a bijection).

   One such bijection is given by:

    $$f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n-1}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\ -\frac{n}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \end{cases}$$

   This maps $1 \mapsto 0, 2 \mapsto -1, 3 \mapsto 1, 4 \mapsto -2, 5 \mapsto 2$, and so on, covering all integers exactly once.

  Prove Proposition 4.11 from the lecture notes on Countability.

   Proposition 4.11 states: Let $A$ be a set. The following are equivalent:

   (a) $A$ is countable.

   (b) There exists an injection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$.

   (c) There exists a surjection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$ (if $A \neq \emptyset$).

  

   (a) $\implies$ (b): If $A$ is countable, then $A$ is either finite or countably infinite. If $A$ is finite, there exists a bijection $f: A \to \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, which is also an injection into $\mathbb{N}$. If $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$, which is also an injection into $\mathbb{N}$.

  

   (b) $\implies$ (a): If there exists an injection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$, then $f$ is a bijection from $A$ to its image $f(A) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Since $f(A)$ is a subset of a countable set, $f(A)$ is countable. Since $A$ is in bijection with a countable set, $A$ is countable.

  

   (a) $\implies$ (c) (if $A \neq \emptyset$): If $A$ is countable, then $A$ is either finite or countably infinite. If $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$, which is also a surjection. If $A$ is finite and nonempty, say $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, we can define a surjection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$ by $g(i) = a_i$ for $1 \le i \le n$, and $g(i) = a_1$ for $i > n$. This step involves making a choice for the elements of $A$.

  

  (c) $\implies$ (a): If there exists a surjection $g: \mathbb{N} \to A$, we can construct an injection $f: A \to \mathbb{N}$ as follows. For each $a \in A$, the set $g^{-1}(\{a\}) = \{n \in \mathbb{N} : g(n) = a\}$ is nonempty. We can choose the smallest element $n_a$ from each $g^{-1}(\{a\})$ and define $f(a) = n_a$. If $f(a) = f(b)$, then $n_a = n_b$, which implies $a = g(n_a) = g(n_b) = b$, so $f$ is injective. Since there exists an injection from $A$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $A$ is countable by part (b). This step uses the Axiom of Choice because we are making a choice from each of the (possibly infinitely many) nonempty sets $g^{-1}(\{a\})$.

  

# 3.

  Let $A$ be a countable set. Prove that $\text{Fin}(A) := \{ X \subseteq A : X \text{ is finite } \}$ is countable.

   If $A$ is finite, then $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is finite, and $\text{Fin}(A) = \mathcal{P}(A)$, so $\text{Fin}(A)$ is countable.

   If $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijection $h: \mathbb{N} \to A$. A finite subset $X \subseteq A$ can be mapped to a finite subset $h^{-1}(X) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable. We can enumerate the finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ by first listing subsets of size 0, then size 1, then size 2, and so on. For each size $k$, we can order the subsets lexicographically. Since there is a bijection between $\text{Fin}(A)$ and the set of finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, $\text{Fin}(A)$ is countable.

  

# 4.

  Let $A$ and $B$ be countable sets. Prove that $A \times B$ is countable. Then show that the Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable.

   If $A$ and $B$ are countable, then there exist surjections $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$ and $g: \mathbb{N} \to B$. We can define a surjection $h: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to A \times B$ by $h(m, n) = (f(m), g(n))$. Since $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable (there exists a bijection with $\mathbb{N}$), and there is a surjection from a countable set to $A \times B$, $A \times B$ is countable.

   By induction, the Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable. The base case ($n=1$) is trivial. Assume that the Cartesian product of $k$ countable sets is countable. Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_{k+1}$ be countable sets. Then $(A_1 \times \dots \times A_k) \times A_{k+1}$ is the Cartesian product of two countable sets, which we have shown is countable. Thus, the Cartesian product of $k+1$ countable sets is countable.

Complete the proof of Corollary 5.5 in the lecture notes on Countability. That is, if $A_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are all countably infinite, mutually disjoint sets and $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to A_n$ witnesses that $A_n$ is countable, prove that $g : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$ defined by $g(n, i) = f_n(i)$ is a bijection. Conclude from this that a countable union of countable sets is countable.

   Since the sets $A_n$ are mutually disjoint, if $g(n, i) = g(m, j)$, then $f_n(i) = f_m(j)$ implies that the element is in $A_n \cap A_m$. Since the sets are disjoint, this can only happen if $n = m$. If $n = m$, then $f_n(i) = f_n(j)$. Since $f_n$ is a bijection, $i = j$. Thus, $g$ is injective.

   For any element $y \in \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$, there exists some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $y \in A_n$. Since $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to A_n$ is a surjection, there exists $i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f_n(i) = y$. Then $g(n, i) = f_n(i) = y$, so $g$ is surjective.

  Since $g$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ to $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$, and $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable, a countable union of countably infinite sets is countable. The case of a countable union of finite sets is similar (or can be embedded into this argument by considering finite sets as subsets of $\mathbb{N}$). Thus, a countable union of countable sets is countable.

   Show that $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}} = \{ (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ is countable, and conclude that $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ is second countable.

   The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is countable. The set of pairs of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ is also countable. There is a bijection between the set of open intervals with rational endpoints and $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$ (mapping $(a, b)$ to $(a, b)$). Therefore, $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is countable.

   The usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable basis $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$. A topological space is second countable if it has a countable basis. Therefore, $\mathbb{R}_{usual}$ is second countable.

 A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is said to have the countable chain condition (ccc) if there are no uncountable collections of mutually disjoint open subsets of $X$. Prove that any separable space is ccc.

  let $X$ be a separable space with a countable dense subset $D \subseteq X$. Suppose $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a collection of pairwise disjoint non-empty open sets in $X$. For each $\alpha \in A$, pick $x_{\alpha} \in U_{\alpha} \cap D$, which is possible since $D$ is dense.

and now as $D$ is countable, the map $\alpha \mapsto x_\alpha$ is injective, so $A$ must also be countable

  Prove the uncountable pigeonhole principle. That is, if $A$ is an uncountable set and $A_n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ are mutually disjoint subsets of $A$ such that $A = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$, show that at least one of the $A_n$ must be uncountable.

Let $A$ be an uncountable set, and let $\{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be mutually disjoint subsets of $A$ such that $A = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that each $A_n$ is countable.

Then, each $A_n$ is a countable set, and the union of countable sets is countable. Hence, the union $\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n$ would also be countable. But this contradicts the assumption that $A$ is uncountable

Show that $\mathcal{B} = \{ B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n : x \in \mathbb{Q}^n \text{ and } 0 < \epsilon \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ is countable, and conclude that $\mathbb{R}^n_{usual}$ is second countable.

The basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathbb{R}^n_{usual}$

$$\mathcal{B} = \{ B(x, r) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \mid x \in \mathbb{Q}^n, \, r \in \mathbb{Q}, \, r > 0 \}$$

 $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is countable as $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and Cartesian products of countable sets are countable.

$\{r \in \mathbb{Q} \mid r > 0\}$ is also countable.

The product $\mathbb{Q}^n \times \{r \in \mathbb{Q} \mid r > 0 \}$ is countable. Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is countable.

  In a previous exercise, you showed that the collection $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ of intervals $[a, b)$ with rational endpoints is not a basis for the Sorgenfrey line. Take this a step further by proving that there is no countable basis for the Sorgenfrey line. That is, prove that the Sorgenfrey line is not second countable.

 Assume, for contradiction, that there is a countable basis $\mathcal{B} = {B_i}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$. For each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, choose $B_{i_x} \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B_{i_x}$. Since $B_{i_x}$ is a finite union of $[a, b)$ intervals, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $[x, x + \varepsilon) \subseteq B_{i_x}$\\

But the Sorgenfrey line has uncountably many disjoint intervals of the form $[x, x + \varepsilon)$ for distinct $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This contradicts the countability of $\mathcal{B}$.

   Suppose $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is countable. Show that there exists a real number $x$ such that $A \cap (x + A) = \emptyset$. (Here, $x + A = \{ x + a : a \in A \}$.)

 Soln.
  countable sets like $A$ leave uncountably many "gaps" in $\mathbb{R}$, and these gaps ensure that a suitable $x$ exists such that $x + A$ avoids $A$.
  
  for any fixed $a \in A$, the shift $x + a$ belongs to a countable set $x + A$. Since $A$ is countable, the union $\bigcup_{a \in A} (x + a)$ is also countable for any fixed $x$.

since $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable and $A \cup (x + A)$ is countable, there exist $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x + A \cap A = \varnothing$. This is because the countable nature of $A$ cannot "fill" $\mathbb{R}$, leaving gaps where such $x$ exists.

Show that the set $2^\mathbb{N}$ of all functions $f : \mathbb{N} \to \{0, 1\}$ is uncountable. (Hint: Use the fact that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable.)

  

define a correspondence between $f \in 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ and subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ by mapping $f$ to $S_f = \{n \in \mathbb{N} \mid f(n) = 1\}$. This gives a bijection between $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, the power set of $\mathbb{N}$.

By Cantor's theorem, $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable. Since $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ is in bijection with $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, it is also uncountable.

 Let $f_n : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) be a fixed collection of functions. Construct a function $g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$,

    $$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} = \infty$$


Define
$$g(k) = k \cdot \max\{f_1(k), f_2(k), \dots, f_k(k)\}.$$
This is well-defined since $\{f_n\}$ is indexed by $\mathbb{N}$ and finite up to $k$ for each $k$.

Fix any $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For all $k \ge n$, $f_n(k) \le \max\{f_1(k), \dots, f_k(k)\}$. So for $k \ge n$,
$$\frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} = \frac{k \cdot \max\{f_1(k), \dots, f_k(k)\}}{f_n(k)} \ge k.$$
Hence, $\frac{g(k)}{f_n(k)} \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$.
Thus, the function $g(k)$ grows faster than every $f_n(k)$.


  $n$ is for counting and limit is being taken over $k$

Let $f, g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be functions. Define the set $B(f,g) := \{k \in \mathbb{N} : f(k) = g(k)\}$. That is, $B(f,g)$ is the set of numbers on which $f$ and $g$ agree.

Your task: Construct a family $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ with the property that for any $g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and any $N \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an $f_n$ in your family such that $|B(f_n,g)| > N$.

Define $$f_n(k) = \begin{cases} g(k) & \text{if } k \le n \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and for arbitrary $g$.

Then $|B(f_n, g)| \ge n+1$ since $f_n(k) = g(k)$ for $k \le n$. So for any $N$, choose $n > N$ and $|B(f_n, g)| > N$.

To make this independent of $g$, define $$f_n^m(k) = \begin{cases} m(k) & \text{if } k \le n \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ for all functions $m: \{0,\dots,n\} \to \mathbb{N}$.

Then the family $\{f_n^m\}$ over all $n$ and all $m$ is countable and satisfies the condition: for any $g$ and $N$, take $n = N+1$ and let $m(k) = g(k)$ for $k \le n$, then $f_n^m(k) = g(k)$ for $k \le n$ so $|B(f_n^m, g)| > N$.

# *** 15.
We have already proved that $(0,1)$ is uncountable and that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable. Prove that these two sets are of the same cardinality. That is, construct a bijection $f : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to (0,1)$ as explicitly as possible.


We construct an explicit bijection from $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ to $(0,1)$ by encoding subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ as binary decimals.
Given $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, define
$$f(A) = \sum_{n \in A} \frac{1}{2^n}.$$
This gives a number in $(0,1)$ since the sum of the full geometric series is $1$. The map $f$ sends distinct subsets to distinct binary expansions.
To avoid ambiguity from dyadic rationals (like $0.1000\ldots = 0.0111\ldots$), exclude finite subsets $A$ from the domain (they correspond to terminating binary decimals). These form a countable set, so removing them from $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ still leaves a set of the same cardinality. Similarly, remove dyadic rationals from $(0,1)$—also countable.
Then $f$ becomes a bijection between:

- the infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, and
- the non-dyadic reals in $(0,1)$.
  
Since countable sets don’t affect cardinality, this gives $|\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})| = |(0,1)|$.
  
  

Start by viewing $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ as the set $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, i.e., infinite binary sequences.
Now:

- If a sequence ends in repeating 0s (e.g. $x = 1000\ldots$), prepend a 0: $0.x$
- If a sequence ends in repeating 1s (e.g. $x = 0111\ldots$), first flip all bits (bitwise NOT), then prepend a 1: $1.\overline{x}$

(this guarantees injectivity and avoids the non-uniqueness of dyadic rationals)
The result is a new binary sequence starting with either 0 or 1, followed by a non-eventually-constant tail. This gives a bijection with sequences that represent real numbers in $(0,1)$ avoiding dyadic ambiguity.
Then interpret the modified binary sequence as a real number in $(0,1)$ using the usual binary decimal expansion.

Finally, if you want to handle the endpoints to get a bijection to $[0,1)$ or even $(0,1)$, do a Hilbert Hotel–style shift:
Pick a countable subset of the image, say the dyadic rationals (which are countable), and move them inward by shifting them along a countable injection $\mathbb{Q}_2 \hookrightarrow (0,1)$ avoiding $0$ and $1$.
This construction is fully explicit, canonical, and tweakable depending on what your codomain target is—$[0,1)$, $(0,1)$, etc.


    We know that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ has the same cardinality as $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, the set of infinite binary sequences. For a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, we can associate a binary sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ where $a_n = 1$ if $n \in A$ and $a_n = 0$ if $n \notin A$.

  

    Consider a number $x \in (0, 1)$ and its binary expansion $0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots$ where $b_i \in \{0, 1\}$. This gives a map from $(0, 1)$ to $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$. This map is almost a bijection, except for numbers with terminating binary expansions (e.g., $0.1 = 0.1000\dots = 0.0111\dots$).

  

    Consider a map $f : \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \to (0, 1)$. For a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, let $f(A) = \sum_{n \in A} \frac{2^{-(n+1)}}{3}$. The image of this map is a subset of $[0, 1]$. If $A \neq B$, suppose $k$ is the smallest element in their symmetric difference. Without loss of generality, assume $k \in A$ and $k \notin B$. Then the contribution of the $k$-th term to $f(A)$ is $\frac{2^{-(k+1)}}{3}$, and to $f(B)$ is 0. The sum of all subsequent terms is bounded by $\sum_{i=k+1}^\infty \frac{2^{-(i+1)}}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{2^{-(k+2)}}{1 - 1/2} = \frac{2^{-(k+1)}}{3}$. This shows that $f(A) \neq f(B)$, so $f$ is injective. Since $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable, the cardinality of $(0, 1)$ is at least the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

  

    Consider a map $g : (0, 1) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. For $x \in (0, 1)$, consider its binary expansion $0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \dots$. Map $x$ to the set $A_x = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : b_n = 1 \}$. This map is not injective due to terminating decimals.

  

    Consider the Cantor set $C$. There is a bijection between $C$ and $\{0, 2\}^\mathbb{N}$, which has the same cardinality as $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. Since $C \subseteq [0, 1]$, the cardinality of $[0, 1]$ is at least the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. Since $(0, 1) \subseteq [0, 1]$, the cardinality of $(0, 1)$ is at most the cardinality of $[0, 1]$.

  

    Map a subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ to the real number $0.a_1 a_2 a_3 \dots$ in base 3, where $a_n = 2$ if $n \in A$ and $a_n = 0$ if $n \notin A$. The image is a subset of the Cantor set, which is in $[0, 1]$. This map is injective.

 Prove that if $A \subseteq [0, 1]$ is countable, then Player II has a winning strategy.

  

    Let $A = \{ a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots \}$ be the countable subset of $[0, 1]$. At the first step, Player I chooses $a_1 \in (0, 1)$. Player II chooses $b_1 \in (a_1, 1)$ such that $b_1 \neq a_1$. The interval is $[a_1, b_1]$. At the second step, Player I chooses $a_2 \in (a_1, b_1)$. Player II chooses $b_2 \in (a_2, b_1)$ such that $b_2 \neq a_2$ and if $a_2 \in A$, choose $b_2$ such that $a_2 \notin [a_2, b_2]$.

  

    Winning strategy for Player II: At step $n$, Player I chooses $a_n \in (a_{n-1}, b_{n-1})$. Player II chooses $b_n \in (a_n, b_{n-1})$ such that $b_n \neq a_n$ and $b_n \neq a_k$ for $k \le n$. This is possible since $(a_n, b_{n-1})$ is an open interval containing infinitely many points. The sequence of closed intervals $C_n = [a_n, b_n]$ is nested, so $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n = \{ a \}$ for some $a \in [0, 1]$. Since Player II ensures that $b_n \neq a_k$ for all $k \le n$, the limit $a$ cannot be any of the $a_k$ in the countable set $A$. Thus, $a \notin A$, and Player II wins.

  

    Corollary: $[0, 1]$ is uncountable. If $[0, 1]$ were countable, then by the above, Player II would have a winning strategy for $A = [0, 1]$. This means the limit $a$ would not be in $[0, 1]$, which is a contradiction since $a$ is the limit of a sequence in $[0, 1]$.

 The $\Delta$-System Lemma is a standard result in set theory and requires more advanced techniques (transfinite induction). The proof is beyond the scope of a quick response.

 Call a subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ a “Y-set” if it is the union of three straight line segments that share a common endpoint. Prove that any collection of mutually disjoint Y-sets is countable.
    
    Each Y-set contains a point with rational coordinates (in fact, an open neighborhood of any point in a Y-set will contain a point with rational coordinates, unless the Y-set is a single point, which is not the case here as it's a union of segments). If we have an uncountable collection of mutually disjoint Y-sets, we can choose a point with rational coordinates from each Y-set. This would give an uncountable collection of distinct points with rational coordinates in R2. However, the set of points with rational coordinates in R2, Q×Q, is countable. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, any collection of mutually disjoint Y-sets must be countable.
    
    More generally, any subset of Rn that contains a non-empty open set (or a part that contains a non-empty open set in a lower-dimensional subspace it spans) will have the property that any uncountable collection of mutually disjoint such sets must be countable. This is because each such set would contain a point with rational coordinates (in the appropriate dimension), and the set of points with rational coordinates in Rn is countable.
    
    - **O-sets (circles):** An uncountable collection of mutually disjoint circles in R2 would lead to an uncountable collection of distinct centers (we can choose the center with rational coordinates if the radius is also rational, or we can use the fact that each circle contains a point with rational coordinates). Thus, an uncountable collection of mutually disjoint circles is not possible.
        
    - **B-sets:** A B-set contains two disjoint open disks (the "holes"). We can pick a point with rational coordinates from each disk. If we have an uncountable collection of disjoint B-sets, we would get an uncountable collection of pairs of rational points, which is still countable. So, an uncountable collection of mutually disjoint B-sets is not possible.
        
    - **H-sets:** An H-set contains two disjoint horizontal line segments (which contain open intervals). Similar to the B-set case, an uncountable collection of disjoint H-sets would lead to a contradiction with the countability of Q2.

 (Please note, this problem is very hard, not to mention outside the scope of this course.)

We define another game, played on $\mathbb{R}$. Player I starts by picking an uncountable set $X_1 \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Player II responds by picking an uncountable set $X_2 \subseteq X_1$. The process then repeats, forming a chain of sets $\mathbb{R} \supseteq X_1 \supseteq X_2 \supseteq X_3 \supseteq \dots$. Player I wins if $X := \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$ is nonempty, and Player II wins if $X=\emptyset$. Prove that Player II always has a winning strategy.

Player II's winning strategy relies on carefully choosing $X_{n+1}$ such that some element is excluded from the intersection at each step.

Strategy for Player II: At step $n$, having received an uncountable set $X_n$ from Player I, Player II picks a countable subset $C_n \subseteq X_n$ such that $X_n \setminus C_n$ is still uncountable. Then Player II chooses $X_{n+1}=X_n \setminus \{c_n\}$ for some $c_n \in C_n$. This ensures $X_{n+1} \subsetneq X_n$.

A more concrete strategy: At step 1, Player I chooses an uncountable $X_1$. Player II chooses a countable subset $C_1 \subseteq X_1$ and lets $X_2=X_1 \setminus \{c_1\}$ for some $c_1 \in C_1$. $X_2$ is still uncountable. At step 2, Player I chooses an uncountable $X_2 \subseteq X_1$. Player II chooses a countable $C_2 \subseteq X_2$ and lets $X_3=X_2 \setminus \{c_2\}$ for some $c_2 \in C_2$.

Consider the case where Player II removes one element at each step. Let $X_1$ be uncountable. Player II picks $x_1 \in X_1$ and sets $X_2=X_1 \setminus \{x_1\}$, which is still uncountable. Player I picks an uncountable $X_2 \subseteq X_1$. Player II picks $x_2 \in X_2$ and sets $X_3=X_2 \setminus \{x_2\}$, still uncountable. Then $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n=X_1 \setminus \{x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots\}$. If Player II can choose the $x_n$'s such that they cover all of $X_1$, then the intersection will be empty. However, Player II's choice depends on Player I's previous move.

Winning Strategy for Player II: At step $n$, Player I provides an uncountable set $X_n$. Player II chooses two distinct elements $a_n,b_n \in X_n$ and declares that if $a_n$ is in the final intersection, Player II wins, and if $b_n$ is in the final intersection, Player II wins. Then Player II sets $X_{n+1}=X_n \setminus \{a_n\}$. Since $X_n$ is uncountable, $X_{n+1}$ is still uncountable. The final intersection $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$ will not contain any of the $a_n$'s chosen by Player II. However, Player I can potentially force a specific element to remain.


The actual winning strategy for Player II involves a more sophisticated argument, possibly using transfinite induction or a diagonalization-like technique to ensure that any element that could potentially be in the intersection is eventually removed. The core idea is that at each step, Player II can reduce the "size" of the uncountable set in a way that guarantees an empty intersection in the limit. This problem is related to concepts in descriptive set theory.
