None of this material will be tested in this class, but I include it for some flavour. It is interesting that all of these notions collapse to the same thing in a metric space.
    Recall the following properties related to compactness that we defined in the lecture notes: 
    1. Compactness; 
    2. Sequential compactness; 
    3. Countable compactness;
    4. Limit point compactness.
       
We also proved (or at least stated) the following relationships between them:

* Compact $\implies$ countably compact.
* Countably compact $\iff$ every infinite subset has an $\omega$-accumulation point.
* Sequentially compact $\implies$ countably compact.
* First countable + countably compact $\implies$ sequentially compact.
* Compact $\not\implies$ sequentially compact (example: $[0, 1]^{[0, 1]}$).
* Sequentially compact $\not\implies$ compact (example: $\omega_1$).
* Second countable $\implies$ (compact $\iff$ countably compact).
* First countable + T$_1$ + limit point compact $\implies$ sequentially compact
* 
 The main result of this section is to prove that in a metric space, all four properties listed above, along with the property of being complete and totally bounded (which we call property 5), are equivalent. This is a two-star series of exercises.

 So let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, thought of as a topological space with its metric topology generated by $d$. Recall that a metrizable space is Hausdorff (and therefore T$_1$), and first countable. Note also that the property that every infinite set has an $\omega$-accumulation point is much stronger than the property of being limit point compact.

Our proof will take the following form:
(1) $\implies$ (2) $\implies$ (3) $\implies$ (4) $\implies$ (1)
and then we will separately prove that (5) is equivalent to these.
Note that we already know (2) $\implies$ (3) and (3) $\implies$ (4) from our list of results above.

1. Prove that (1) $\implies$ (2). This is almost entirely done by the results above.
   
2. Suppose $X$ is limit point compact. Let $\mathcal{U} = \{U_\alpha : \alpha \in I \}$ be a given open cover of $X$. Show that there is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all $x \in X$, $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq U_\alpha$ for some $\alpha \in I$.
   Hint: Suppose there is no such $\epsilon > 0$. Then for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we can find a point $x_n \in X$ such that $B_{1/n}(x_n)$ is not a subset of any element of $\mathcal{U}$.

(a) Show that $A := \{ x_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is infinite.

(b) Since $X$ is limit point compact, let $a$ be a limit point of $A$. Then $a \in U$ for some $U \in \mathcal{U}$, and therefore there is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_\epsilon(a) \subseteq U$. Derive a contradiction from here.

3. Prove that (4) $\implies$ (1).
   Hint: Use the previous part.

4. We now prove that (5) $\iff$ (2).
   ($\Leftarrow$). Suppose $(X, d)$ is sequentially compact (and therefore compact).
   (a) Prove that $X$ is totally bounded.
   (b) To show that the space is complete, note that every Cauchy sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence, since $X$ is sequentially compact. Use this to show that the whole sequence converges.
   
   ($\implies$). Suppose $(X, d)$ is complete and totally bounded, and let $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $X$. We want to show that it has a convergent subsequence, and by completeness it suffices to show it has a Cauchy subsequence.

   (a) Suppose $\mathcal{U}_1$ is a cover of $X$ by finitely many metric balls of radius 1. Show that there is a ball $B_1 \in \mathcal{U}_1$ that contains infinitely many members of the sequence. Call the corresponding set of indices $A_1 = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : x_n \in B_1 \}$.

   (b) Suppose $\mathcal{U}_2$ is a cover of $X$ by finitely many metric balls of radius $\frac{1}{2}$. Show that there is a ball $B_2 \in \mathcal{U}_2$ and an infinite subset $A_2 \subseteq A_1$ such that $x_n \in B_2$ for all $n \in A_2$.

   (c) Proceeding inductively, we construct a collection of open balls $B_n$ of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ for each $n$, and a sequence of infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ $A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq A_3 \supseteq \cdots$ such that $A_k = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : n \in B_k \}$.

   (d) Show that we can inductively choose numbers $n_k \in A_k$ such that $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \cdots$.

   (e) Show that the subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of our original sequence is Cauchy.
