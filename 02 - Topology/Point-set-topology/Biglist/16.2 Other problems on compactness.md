 Let $(X, \mathcal{T} )$ be a topological space, and let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for the topology. Prove that $X$ is compact if and only if every open cover of $X$ consisting of basic open sets has a finite subcover. 
 
   (Interesting note: You can even replace “basic” with “subbasic”, but this fact is highly nontrivial; it is called the [Alexander Subbase Theorem](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Alexander%27s_Compactness_Theorem).)

**Theorem:**
Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space with basis $\mathcal{B}$. Then $X$ is compact if and only if every open cover of $X$ consisting of basic open sets from $\mathcal{B}$ has a finite subcover.

**Proof:**

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $X$ is compact.
Let $\mathcal{U} = \{B_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be an open cover of $X$ with each $B_\alpha \in \mathcal{B}$.

Since each $B_\alpha$ is open (as $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$), $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $X$.

By compactness, there is a finite subcover:
$$X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n B_{\alpha_i}.$$
Done — the finite subcover consists of basic open sets.

($\Leftarrow$) Now assume every open cover of $X$ by basic open sets has a finite subcover.

Let $\mathcal{U} = \{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ be any open cover of $X$ (not necessarily basic).

Each $U_\lambda$ is open, so for every $x \in X$, $x \in U_\lambda$ for some $\lambda$.
Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, for each $x \in X$, there exists $B_x \in \mathcal{B}$ such that:
$$x \in B_x \subseteq U_\lambda.$$
That is, for every $x \in X$, there is a basic open set $B_x$ contained in some $U_\lambda$ that contains $x$.

So the collection $\{B_x : x \in X\}$ is a cover of $X$ by basis elements.
By assumption, a finite subcover $\{B_{x_1}, \dots, B_{x_n}\}$ exists.

Each $B_{x_i} \subseteq U_{\lambda_i}$, so the corresponding $\{U_{\lambda_1}, \dots, U_{\lambda_n}\}$ also covers $X$.
Hence, every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover: $X$ is compact.

 Show that any finite union of compact subsets of a topological space is compact, and that an arbitrary intersection of compact subsets of a Hausdorff topological space is compact.
Soln.

Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$. That is, $K \subseteq \bigcup_{j \in J} U_j$ where each $U_j \in \mathcal{U}$. Then for each $i = 1, \dots, n$, the compact set $K_i$ is covered by $\mathcal{U}$, so there exists a finite subcollection $\mathcal{U}_i \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ such that $K_i \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{U}_i$.
Now, let $\mathcal{U}' = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \mathcal{U}_i$, which is a finite union of finite sets, hence finite. Then
$$K = \bigcup_{i=1}^n K_i \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n \bigcup \mathcal{U}_i = \bigcup \mathcal{U}'.$$
Thus, $\mathcal{U}'$ is a finite subcover of $\mathcal{U}$ covering $K$, so $K$ is compact. 

Let $\{K_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be a collection of compact subsets of a Hausdorff topological space $X$, and let $K = \bigcap_{\alpha \in A} K_\alpha$. We will show that $K$ is compact.

Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$. Since $K \subseteq K_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$, $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $K$ but not necessarily of each $K_\alpha$. However, for each point $x \in K$, since $\mathcal{U}$ covers $K$, there exists $U_x \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $x \in U_x$. Thus, the family $\mathcal{U}$ is a neighborhood cover of $K$.
Because $X$ is Hausdorff and each $K_\alpha$ is compact, compact subsets are closed, and arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed, so $K$ is closed in each $K_\alpha$ and hence in $X$. Now, since $K$ is a closed subset of each compact set $K_\alpha$, and closed subsets of compact sets in a Hausdorff space are compact, $K$ is compact.

Alternatively and more directly: in a Hausdorff space, compact subsets are closed, so each $K_\alpha$ is closed; hence their intersection $K$ is closed. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $K$; since $K \subseteq K_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$, and each $K_\alpha$ is compact, for any finite subcollection of the $\mathcal{U}$ that covers $K$, it still covers $K$ in $X$. Thus, $K$ has a finite subcover from $\mathcal{U}$, so $K$ is compact. $\blacksquare$

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Let $C, K \subseteq X$ be disjoint subsets such that $C$ is closed and $K$ is compact. Show that $d(C, K) > 0$, where $d(C, K) = \inf \{ d(c, x) : c \in C, x \in K \}$.

Proof.
 Suppose for contradiction that $d(C, K) = 0$. Then there exist sequences $(c_n) \subseteq C$ and $(x_n) \subseteq K$ such that
$$d(c_n, x_n) \to 0.$$
Since $K$ is compact, the sequence $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence: $x_{n_k} \to x \in K$.
Now,
$$d(c_{n_k}, x_{n_k}) \to 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x_{n_k} \to x,$$
so $c_{n_k} \to x$ as well by the triangle inequality.
But each $c_{n_k} \in C$, and $C$ is closed, so $x \in C$. Hence $x \in C \cap K$, contradicting that $C \cap K = \emptyset$.

Therefore, $\boxed{d(C, K) > 0}$.

Show that every compact metrizable space is second countable. Conclude that every compact metrizable space is hereditarily separable and hereditarily ccc.

Proof.
Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metrizable space.
Since $X$ is metrizable, there exists a countable basis if and only if $X$ is second countable. So we construct one.
Let $\mathcal{B}_n = \{ B(x, 1/n) : x \in X \}$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The family $\mathcal{B}_n$ is an open cover of $X$.
By compactness, each $\mathcal{B}_n$ admits a finite subcover $\{ B(x_{n,1}, 1/n), \dots, B(x_{n,k_n}, 1/n) \}$. Let $\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{j=1}^{k_n} B(x_{n,j}, 1/n)$. This gives a countable basis.
Hence, $X$ is second countable.


Every second countable space is separable and ccc.
These properties are hereditary for subspaces of second countable spaces.
Therefore, every compact metrizable space is hereditarily separable and hereditarily ccc.

Show that every compact metrizable space is sequentially compact. That is, let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a compact metrizable space, and let $\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $X$. Show that it has a convergent subsequence.
Hint: First, take care of the case where $S = \{ x_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is finite. Now assume the sequence has no convergent subsequences. Show that for each $x \in S$, there is an $\epsilon_x > 0$ such that $B_{\epsilon_x}(x) \cap S = \{x\}$. Then show that $\mathcal{U} = \{ B_{\epsilon_x}(x) : x \in S \} \cup \{X \setminus S\}$ is a cover of $X$ with no finite subcover.

Proof.

Case 1: The set $S = \{ x_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is finite.
Then some $x \in S$ appears infinitely often, say $x_{n_k} = x$ for all $k$, so the constant subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ converges to $x$.

Case 2: $S$ is infinite.
Assume for contradiction that $\{x_n\}$ has no convergent subsequence. Then for each $x \in S$, there exists $\epsilon_x > 0$ such that
$$B_{\epsilon_x}(x) \cap S = \{x\},$$
since otherwise $x$ would be a limit point of $\{x_n\}$ and hence a subsequence would converge to it.
Then define the open cover
$$\mathcal{U} = \{B_{\epsilon_x}(x) : x \in S\} \cup \{X \setminus S\}.$$
This is an open cover of $X$, since $S$ is countable and $\bigcup \mathcal{U} \supseteq S \cup (X \setminus S) = X$.
But any finite subcollection $\{B_{\epsilon_{x_i}}(x_i)\}_{i=1}^n \cup \{X \setminus S\}$ covers only finitely many points of $S$, since each $B_{\epsilon_{x_i}}(x_i)$ contains only $x_i$, and $X \setminus S$ excludes $S$.
So this finite subcover fails to cover $X$. Hence $\mathcal{U}$ has no finite subcover — contradicting compactness of $X$.
Therefore, $\{x_n\}$ must have a convergent subsequence. 
# * 6.
Determine which of the following spaces are compact.
(a) $\mathbb{R}_{co-finite}$.

$\mathbb{R}_{\text{co-finite}}$ is compact. Any open cover consists of co-finite sets, so finitely many of them have finite complements whose intersection is finite, and hence the union of those sets is co-finite, covering all but finitely many points. We can then include finitely many more sets to cover the rest, giving a finite subcover.

The compact subsets are all subsets, since any subset in this topology is compact due to the same finiteness condition.

---
(b) $\mathbb{R}_{co-countable}$.

$\mathbb{R}_{\text{co-countable}}$ is not compact. Consider the open cover $\{ \mathbb{R} \setminus \{x\} : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$ — each open set is co-countable, and their union covers $\mathbb{R}$, but no finite subcollection can cover $\mathbb{R}$.

Compact subsets are those that are countable: otherwise, complements of compact subsets are not open, as the intersection of countable sets is countable.

---
(c) $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_7)$ (the particular point topology at 7).

$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_7)$ is compact. Every open set contains the point 7, so any open cover must include sets all containing 7, and any point outside a finite number of such open sets can only be covered finitely often. Thus, finitely many open sets cover the whole space.

The compact subsets are those that are finite or contain 7.

---
(d) $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_{ray})$.

$(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}_{\text{ray}})$ is not compact. Consider the cover $\{ (-\infty, n) : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$; it is open in this topology, but no finite subcover covers all of $\mathbb{R}$.

The compact subsets are precisely the bounded-above subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ that have a maximum.

---
(e) $(-\infty, \alpha]$, as subspace of $\omega_1$ with its order topology, for any $\alpha \in \omega_1$.

$(-\infty, \alpha] \subseteq \omega_1$ is compact. It is a closed interval in the order topology on a well-ordered set, and any open cover has a minimal upper bound among covered points, ensuring a finite subcover exists.

Compact subsets of $\omega_1$ are the closed and bounded subsets — hence of the form $[0, \beta]$ for $\beta < \omega_1$.

---
(f) A subset $A \subseteq \omega_1$ with no largest element.

A subset $A \subseteq \omega_1$ with no largest element is not compact. Any open cover must include neighborhoods around each point, but since there's no maximal point, we can't extract a finite subcover to cover all of $A$.

Compact subsets are those with a largest element — that is, the closed and bounded subsets.

---

After you have done that, try to characterize the compact subsets of each space.

# ** 7.

**In an earlier exercise in this section, you showed that the intersection of compact subsets of a Hausdorff space is again compact.**
Give an example to show that Hausdorffness is necessary in that result. That is, *construct a non-Hausdorff topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ with two compact subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $A \cap B$ is not compact.*

You will need to construct a space here, but you don’t have to work too hard. The easiest way to do it is to start with $\mathbb{N}_{\text{discrete}}$ and add some points and new open sets containing those points.



Let $X = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, and define a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ as follows:


1. All subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are open (i.e., $\mathbb{N}$ has the discrete topology).
2. A set containing $\infty$ is open *iff* its complement in $X$ is finite (i.e., neighborhoods of $\infty$ are co-finite subsets containing $\infty$).

This is the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{N}_{\text{discrete}}$, but it is not Hausdorff: any two points $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\infty$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.
Now define:

Let $X' = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty, \infty'\}$, where $\infty'$ is a new point. Extend the topology $\mathcal{T}'$ on $X'$ such that:

 1. All subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are still open.
  2. A set is open if it contains $\infty$ or $\infty'$, and its complement in $X'$ is finite.
 
Then $X'$ is not Hausdorff: $\infty$ and $\infty'$ cannot be separated.
Now consider the subsets:
$$A = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$$
$$B = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty'\}$$
Both $A$ and $B$ are compact in the topology $\mathcal{T}'$. For $A$, any open cover must contain a co-finite set $U$ containing $\infty$. Then $A \setminus U$ is finite, and each point in $A \setminus U \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is open, so we can cover them with finitely many open singletons. Thus, $A$ has a finite subcover. Similarly, $B$ is compact.

Their intersection is $A \cap B = \mathbb{N}$. In the subspace topology on $\mathbb{N}$ induced by $\mathcal{T}'$, every subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is open (since singletons are open in $\mathcal{T}'$). Thus, $\mathbb{N}$ with the subspace topology is the discrete topology on $\mathbb{N}$. The open cover $\{\{n\} : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ of $\mathbb{N}$ has no finite subcover, so $\mathbb{N}$ is not compact.

Let $(L, \leq)$ be a linear order, thought of as a topological space with its order topology.
Show that $L$ is compact if and only if every nonempty subset of $L$ has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound.
*Hint: This is very similar to the “creeping along” proof that $[0, 1]$ is compact.*

# ** 9.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, let $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be a compact Hausdorff space, and let $f : X \to Y$ be a function. Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if the graph of $f$, which is the set
$$\Gamma_f = \{ (x, f(x)) \in X \times Y : x \in X \}$$
is closed.

$\Rightarrow$
Suppose $f : X \to Y$ is continuous.
 Let $(x, y) \notin \Gamma_f$, so $y \ne f(x)$. Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets $V_1 \ni f(x)$ and $V_2 \ni y$. By continuity of $f$, $U = f^{-1}(V_1)$ is open in $X$ and contains $x$. Then $U \times V_2$ is an open neighborhood of $(x, y)$ in $X \times Y$ disjoint from $\Gamma_f$ (since if $(x', f(x')) \in \Gamma_f \cap (U \times V_2)$, then $f(x') \in V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset$). So every point not in $\Gamma_f$ has an open neighborhood disjoint from it, proving that $\Gamma_f$ is closed.
 
 
*Hint: The ($\Leftarrow$) direction is the tricky one. Prove this intermediary lemma first, then the result follows:*

**Lemma**. Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ a compact space. Then the first projection function $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X$ is closed. 

# ** 10.

In this exercise we are going to define a new topological space called the Cantor set that is one of the most classic (and most counterintuitive) examples in point set topology.

Let $C_0 = [0, 1]$, with its usual topology. Let $C_1 = [0, \frac{1}{3}] \cup [\frac{2}{3}, 1]$. Let $C_2 = [0, \frac{1}{9}] \cup [\frac{2}{9}, \frac{1}{3}] \cup [\frac{2}{3}, \frac{7}{9}] \cup [\frac{8}{9}, 1]$. Continue this process inductively, with $C_n$ being the set obtained from $C_{n-1}$ by deleting the open middle third of each of the intervals in $C_{n-1}$.


Then the Cantor set $C$ is defined as $C := \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n$.

(a) Show that $C \neq \emptyset$.

(b) Show that $C$ is uncountable.

(c) Show that $C$ is closed, and conclude from this that $C$ is compact.

(d) A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called perfect if for every $x \in A$ and every open set $U$ containing $x$, $(U \cap A) \setminus \{x\} \neq \emptyset$. Show that $C$ is perfect.

(e) Show that $\operatorname{int}(C) = \emptyset$.

(f) Show that the outer measure of $C$ is zero.

(g) Show that the Cantor set consists precisely of those elements of $[0, 1]$ that have a ternary expansion containing no 1s. 
(Note that a number can have more than one decimal expansion in base 3, since for example the real number $\frac{1}{3}$—which is in $C$—has the two expansions $0.1_3$ and $0.0222\dots_3$ in base 3. So another way to phrase this question is: Show that $[0, 1] \setminus C$ is the collection of real numbers in $[0, 1]$ all of whose base 3 expansions contain a 1.)


After you have done these exercises, take a moment to think about these results together and convince yourself that C is weird. It is not unusual to satisfy any one of these properties; we know lots of uncountable subsets of the reals, lots of compact subsets of the reals, we know Q is perfect, and we know lots of sets with empty interiors. It is weird that C has all of these properties simultaneously. We will explore the Cantor set a little more after we study connectedness.

Let $X := \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$ with the product topology induced by the discrete topology in each factor.
Show that $X$ is compact directly (i.e., without using Tychonoff’s theorem) by showing that $X$ is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

Hint: By the last part of the previous exercise, every element $a$ of $C$ can be written as
$$a = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{3^n},$$
for some sequence $\{a_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of 0s and 2s.

# 12.

The previous result, that $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$ is homeomorphic to the Cantor set, is a very important one in topology. The Cantor set $C$ (which from this point onwards we will think of interchangeably as both $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$ and as the subset of the reals we constructed earlier) turns out to contain all the information of a great number of topological spaces.

(a) Show that $C$ is homeomorphic to $C^\mathbb{N}$ (with the product topology).

(b) Prove that $[0, 1]$ is a continuous image of $C$.
Hint: Consider the map $f: C \to [0, 1]$ defined by $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{3^n} \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{2^{n+1}}$, where $a_n \in \{0, 2\}$.

(c) Conclude that $H := [0, 1]^\mathbb{N}$ is a continuous image of $C$.

(d) Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be any compact metrizable topological space. Show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a subset of $H$.
Hint: Let $D = \{ x_n : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ be a countable dense subset of $X$. Let $d$ be a metric on $X$ bounded by 1. Define $F : X \to H$ by $F(x) = (d(x, x_1), d(x, x_2), d(x, x_3), \dots)$. Show that $F$ is a continuous injection.

(e) Conclude that **every compact metrizable space is a continuous image of the Cantor set**.This is a very powerful result. By now I hope you are convinced that the Cantor set is very importan

# 13.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ be topological spaces, and let $f : X \to Y$ be a closed, surjective, continuous function such that for every $y \in Y$, $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is a compact subset of $X$. Such a map is called a perfect map.

(a) Show that if $X$ is Hausdorff, then $Y$ is Hausdorff.

(b) Show that if $X$ is second countable, then $Y$ is second countable.

(c) Show that if $Y$ is compact, then $X$ is compact.

(d) Show that perfect maps are “rigid” in the sense that they cannot be extended continuously to closures: Let $X$ be Hausdorff and $f : X \to Y$ be a perfect map. Suppose $Z$ is a Hausdorff space that contains $X$ as a dense proper subspace. Show that there is no continuous function $F : Z \to Y$ such that $F(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in X$.
(Hint: Do a proof by contradiction.)

# 14.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space which is compact as a topological space with its metric topology, and let $f : X \to \mathbb{R}_{usual}$ be a continuous function. Show that $f$ is uniformly continuous.

# 15.

This exercise defines a condition on topological spaces that is of particular interest to algebraic geometers. As you will see, this property is much stronger than compactness.

**Definition 16.1.** A topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called Noetherian if every ascending chain of open sets stabilizes. That is, if $U_1 \subseteq U_2 \subseteq U_3 \subseteq \cdots$ is an ascending sequence of open sets, then there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $U_n = U_m$ for all $n, m > N$.

(a) Show that the property of being Noetherian is hereditary.

(b) Show that every Noetherian space is compact.
 Hint: Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be Noetherian and let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $X$. Consider the collection $\mathcal{A}$ of all finite unions of elements of $\mathcal{U}$. Apply Zorn’s Lemma to $\mathcal{A}$, and show that the maximal element is $X$.

(c) Conclude from the previous two exercises that every Noetherian space is hereditarily compact.

(d) Show a topological space is Hausdorff and hereditarily compact if and only if it is finite and discrete.
The property of being hereditarily compact is very strong, and can be counterintuitive. Every open subset of a hereditarily compact space is compact, for example. The following exercise should give you some impression of how strong it is.

(e) Show that any Hausdorff Noetherian space is finite and discrete.

# 16.

This is for the student interested in category theory. These exercises are not particularly difficult, but they are enough outside the scope of this course (and notationally heavy enough) that no one should feel obligated to do them. Still, they are pretty cool.

Let $\{ (X_n, \mathcal{T}_n) : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ be a collection of topological spaces, and assume that for each $n > 1$, $f_n : X_n \to X_{n-1}$ is a continuous function. The sequence
$$X_1 \stackrel{f_2}{\leftarrow} X_2 \stackrel{f_3}{\leftarrow} X_3 \stackrel{f_4}{\leftarrow} \cdots ,$$
is called an inverse system of topological spaces, which we denote by $\langle (X_n, \mathcal{T}_n), f_n \rangle$, or simply $\langle X_n, f_n \rangle$ if the topologies on each space are clear .(In general, an inverse system is defined on a directed set rather than the naturals; we are examining a simpler special case in this problem.)

In this context, the sequence above is a generalization of a sequence $X_1 \supseteq X_2 \supseteq X_3 \supseteq \cdots$ of nested spaces (each space would have its subspace topology from the topology on $X_1$, and the maps would be inclusions).

We define the inverse limit of this sequence, denoted by $\varprojlim X_n$, as the set:
$$\varprojlim X_n := \left\{ \{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n : f_n(x_n) = x_{n-1} \text{ for all } n > 1 \right\}$$
(which is a topological space with its subspace topology inherited from the product topology on $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$).

(a) Prove that if $\langle X_n, f_n \rangle$ is a nested sequence, meaning $X_1 \supseteq X_2 \supseteq X_3 \supseteq \cdots$, and $f_n : X_n \to X_{n-1}$ is the natural inclusion map for every $n > 1$, then **$\varprojlim X_n$ is homeomorphic to $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$** (with its subspace topology inherited from $\mathcal{T}_1$).

Define the map $\phi : \varprojlim X_n \to \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$ by $\phi({x_n}) = x_1$. This is well-defined: since $f_n(x_n) = x_{n-1}$ and $f_n$ is the inclusion $X_n \hookrightarrow X_{n-1}$, we have $x_n \in X_n \subseteq X_{n-1}$, so inductively $x_n \in X_1$ for all $n$, and $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \cdots$, hence all $x_n$ are equal and lie in every $X_n$, so $x_1 \in \bigcap X_n$. Conversely, for any $x \in \bigcap X_n$, define $x_n := x$ for all $n$; then ${x_n} \in \prod X_n$ satisfies $f_n(x_n) = x = x_{n-1}$, so ${x_n} \in \varprojlim X_n$, giving a well-defined inverse $\psi(x) = {x}_n$.

Clearly $\phi$ and $\psi$ are inverses, so $\varprojlim X_n \cong \bigcap X_n$ as sets. Since $\phi$ is the restriction of the projection $\pi_1$ to the closed subspace $\varprojlim X_n \subseteq \prod X_n$, and $\pi_1$ is continuous and open onto its image, $\phi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, which is $\bigcap X_n$ with the subspace topology from $X_1$, as required.

(b) Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space, and let $\langle X_n, f_n \rangle$ be the constant inverse system, where $X_n = X$ and $f_n = \text{id}_X$ for all $n$. Show that $\varprojlim X_n \cong X$.

Define $\phi : \varprojlim X_n \to X$ by $\phi({x_n}) = x_1$. Since $f_n = \mathrm{id}_X$, the condition $f_n(x_n) = x_{n-1}$ becomes $x_n = x_{n-1}$ for all $n$, so all $x_n$ are equal, say $x_n = x$ for some $x \in X$. Thus, $\varprojlim X_n$ consists of constant sequences ${x}_n$, and $\phi({x}_n) = x$ is a bijection. Its inverse $\psi : X \to \varprojlim X_n$ is given by $\psi(x) = {x}_n$, which clearly satisfies $f_n(x) = x = x_{n-1}$ for all $n$, hence lies in $\varprojlim X_n$. Both $\phi$ and $\psi$ are continuous: $\phi$ is just the projection $\pi_1$, which is continuous in the product topology, and $\psi$ is the diagonal map $x \mapsto {x}_n$, which is continuous into the product since each component map is continuous. Therefore, $\phi$ is a homeomorphism, and $\varprojlim X_n \cong X$.

(c) If $(Y, \mathcal{U})$ is a topological space and $g_n : Y \to X_n$ is a continuous function with the property that $g_{n-1} = f_n \circ g_n$ for all $n > 1$, then there exists a unique continuous function $u : Y \to \varprojlim X_n$ such that $g_n = \pi_n \circ u$ (where $\pi_n$ is the usual projection function, restricted to $\varprojlim X_n \subseteq \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$).
Prove this. Then try to interpret this property in the context of specific inverse systems of topological spaces. For example, in the context of part (a), this says that $A \subseteq \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X_n$ if and only if $A \subseteq X_n$ for all $n$.
This universal property actually characterizes the inverse limit. A category theorist would most likely take this as a definition of the inverse limit, then carry out the construction we did above as a proof that such objects exist and are unique in the category of topological spaces


Define $u : Y \to \prod X_n$ by $$u(y) := \{g_n(y)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}.$$Since each $g_n$ is continuous, $u$ is continuous by the universal property of the product topology. Moreover, for $n > 1$, we are given that $f_n \circ g_n = g_{n-1}$, so for every $y \in Y$,$$f_n(g_n(y)) = g_{n-1}(y),$$ which implies $u(y) \in \varprojlim X_n$. Hence $u : Y \to \varprojlim X_n$ is well-defined and continuous as a map into the subspace. For each $n$, the $n$th coordinate of $u(y)$ is $g_n(y)$, so $\pi_n \circ u = g_n$. For uniqueness, suppose $v : Y \to \varprojlim X_n$ is another continuous map such that $\pi_n \circ v = g_n$ for all $n$. Then $v(y) = \{g_n(y)\} = u(y)$, so $v = u$. Thus, such $u$ exists and is unique.


(d) Prove that if $\langle X_n, f_n \rangle$ is an inverse system of nonempty compact Hausdorff spaces, then $\varprojlim X_n$ is a nonempty compact Hausdorff space.

Each $X_n$ is compact Hausdorff, so their product $\prod X_n$ is compact by Tychonoff’s theorem and Hausdorff since a product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff. Define
$$\varprojlim X_n = \left\{ \{x_n\} \in \prod X_n : f_n(x_n) = x_{n-1} \text{ for all } n > 1 \right\}.$$This is the intersection of the inverse images of the closed sets $\{(x_n, x_{n-1}) : f_n(x_n) = x_{n-1}\}$ under the continuous maps $x \mapsto (x_n, x_{n-1})$, hence closed in $\prod X_n$. Therefore, $\varprojlim X_n$ is closed in a compact space, so compact, and closed in a Hausdorff space, so Hausdorff.
To show nonemptiness, proceed inductively: since each $X_n$ is nonempty compact Hausdorff, for each finite level $N$ the finite inverse limit $\varprojlim_{n \le N} X_n$ is nonempty and compact. These finite inverse limits form a projective system of nonempty compact spaces with surjective bonding maps (since each $f_n$ maps onto its image in a compact Hausdorff setting). Then the inverse limit $\varprojlim X_n$ is the inverse limit of this projective system and hence is nonempty by the Mittag-Leffler condition or compactness arguments. Thus, $\varprojlim X_n$ is nonempty, compact, and Hausdorff.

(e) For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define a basis $\mathcal{B}_n$ on $\mathbb{N}$ by $\mathcal{B}_n = \{ \{1\}, \{2\}, \dots, \{n\}, \{n+1, n+2, \dots \} \}$. Let $\mathcal{T}_n$ be the topology it generates.

i.Show that $(\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{T}_n)$ is compact but not Hausdorff for every $n$.
ii. Show that the identity map $\text{id} : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ given by $\text{id}(x) = x$ is continuous when viewed as a map from $(\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{T}_n)$ to $(\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{T}_{n-1})$ for all $n > 2$.
    
iii. The previous exercise shows us that $\langle (\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{T}_n), \text{id} \rangle$ is an inverse system. Let $(X, \mathcal{T}) = \varprojlim (\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{T}_n)$ be its inverse limit. What is it?

iv. Conclude that an inverse limit of compact non-Hausdorff spaces need not be compact.

(f) If you have two inverse systems $\langle X_n, f_n \rangle$ and $\langle Y_n, g_n \rangle$, and continuous functions $\phi_n : X_n \to Y_n$ for every $n$ such that
$$\phi_{n-1} \circ f_n = g_n \circ \phi_n \quad (*)$$
for all $n > 1$, then there is a continuous function $\varprojlim X_n \to \varprojlim Y_n$. The condition $(*)$ can be visualized by the commutative diagram:








 

The statement $\phi_{n-1} \circ f_n = g_n \circ \phi_n$ above amounts to saying that this diagram commutes, meaning that if you start at a point and go to another point along two different paths of arrows, the resulting compositions of arrows are equal.
So, we say that a function $\Phi = (\phi_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} : \langle X_n, f_n \rangle \to \langle Y_n, g_n \rangle$ is continuous provided the functions $\phi_n$ are continuous for all $n$, and that they obey the condition outlined above. Finally, we define an induced function $\phi : \varprojlim X_n \to \varprojlim Y_n$ by
$$\phi(\{x_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}) = \{\phi_n(x_n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$$
Prove that this map $\phi$ is well defined, in the sense that it actually maps into $\varprojlim Y_n$.

(g) Prove that if Φ is continuous, then ϕ is continuous.

(h) If you are still interested in learning more about this, talk to me. There is a lot of room to generalize these definitions to get very powerful tools. For example, in this discussion we only mentioned inverse systems indexed by N, when in fact we can create a similar object indexed by any directed set (recall that definition from my supplementary notes on nets and filters). This allows us to prove some nice results, like that every topological spaces is an inverse limit of spaces whose topologies are finite. 56 There are also direct limits, which are like inverse limits except all the arrows go the other way. 
Direct limits are generalizations of unions the same way inverse limits are generalizations of intersections. While this all looks complicated, inverse and direct limits are a very basic tool for a lot of higher mathematics. They can be defined in any category, and not just for topological spaces.

PS: Diagrams are a great way of looking at certain relationships. For example, the universal property of inverse limits described in part (c) is more readily illustrated by saying that following diagram commutes for all n > 1.
