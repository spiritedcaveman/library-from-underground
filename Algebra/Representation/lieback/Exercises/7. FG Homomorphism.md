Let $U, V,$ and $W$ be $FG$-modules, and let $\psi: U \to V$ and $\phi: V \to W$ be $FG$-homomorphisms. Prove that $\phi \circ \psi: U \to W$ is an $FG$-homomorphism.

Proof.
 easy just think of the kernel of those 3 maps and we are done

Let $G$ be the subgroup of $S_5$ which is generated by $(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)$. Prove that the permutation module for $G$ over $F$ is isomorphic to the regular $FG$-module.

Proof.
  Let $G = \langle (1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5) \rangle \leq S_5$, a cyclic group of order 5. The permutation module over a field $F$ is the $F$-vector space $V = F^5$ with $G$ acting by permuting coordinates. Since the generator acts as a 5-cycle, this action is transitive and faithful. By definition, the regular $FG$-module is also 5-dimensional and has a basis $\{e_g\}_{g \in G}$ with $G$ acting by left multiplication.
  The permutation action on $V$ shifts basis vectors cyclically, just as left multiplication in $FG$ permutes basis elements by group action.
  Thus, both are 5-dimensional, faithful, and exhibit the same cyclic structure, so the permutation module is isomorphic to the regular $FG$-module.

Assume that $V$ is an $FG$-module. Prove that the subset
$$V^G = \{ v \in V : vg = v \text{ for all } g \in G \}$$is an $FG$-submodule of $V$.

Soln.
 Let $V$ be an $FG$-module, and define $V^G = \{v \in V : vg = v \text{ for all } g \in G\}$. This is the set of $G$-invariant vectors. It is clearly closed under addition and scalar multiplication from $F$, so it's a subspace. Now, for any $\alpha = \sum_{g \in G} a_g g \in FG$ and any $v \in V^G$, we compute
$$v\alpha = v \left( \sum_{g \in G} a_g g \right) = \sum_{g \in G} a_g (vg) = \sum_{g \in G} a_g v = \left( \sum_{g \in G} a_g \right)v,$$
since $vg = v$ for all $g \in G$. Hence $v\alpha \in V^G$, so $V^G$ is closed under the action of $FG$, and thus an $FG$-submodule.

**This also reflects the fact that the orbit of $v$ is a singleton, and so the stabilizer is all of $G$, giving a fixed point under the action — a pattern general to any such module.**

Show that the function$$\psi: v \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} vg \quad (v \in V)$$
# **is an $FG$-homomorphism from $V$ to $V^G$. Is it necessarily surjective?**

Soln.
 
 $$\psi(vh) = \sum_{g \in G} (vh)g = \sum_{g \in G} v(hg) = \sum_{g' \in G} vg' = \psi(v),$$
 since $G$ is a group and $g \mapsto hg$ is a bijection. So $\psi(vh) = \psi(v)$ for all $h \in G$, hence $\psi(v) \in V^G$, and $\psi$ commutes with the $G$-action: $\psi(v)h = \psi(v)$, i.e., it’s $G$-equivariant. Thus, $\psi$ is an $FG$-module homomorphism $V \to V^G$.
 
 
As for surjectivity: $\psi$ lands in $V^G$, but the image need not be all of $V^G$ unless $V^G$ is spanned by such averages. In general, $\psi$ is not necessarily surjective. For instance, if $V = FG$ (the regular module), then $V^G$ is 1-dimensional, but $\psi$ maps all of $V$ into the line spanned by $\sum_g g$, which is fine — but in more general $V$, $V^G$ may contain elements not arising from such sums.

Conclusion: $\psi$ is an $FG$-homomorphism $V \to V^G$, but not necessarily surjective.

Suppose that $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic $FG$-modules. Define the $FG$-submodules $V^G$ and $W^G$ of $V$ and $W$ as in Exercise 3. Prove that $V^G$ and $W^G$ are isomorphic $FG$-module

Soln.

Let $\phi: V \to W$ be an $FG$-module isomorphism. Then for any $v \in V^G$, we have $vg = v$ for all $g \in G$. **Since $\phi$ is $FG$-linear**,
$$\phi(vg) = \phi(v)g = \phi(v).$$
So $\phi(v) \in W^G$. Thus, $\phi(V^G) \subseteq W^G$.

Similarly, $\phi^{-1}: W \to V$ is $FG$-linear, so the reverse inclusion holds. Hence, $\phi$ restricts to an isomorphism $V^G \cong W^G$ as $FG$-modules.

Let $G$ be the subgroup of $S_4$ which is generated by $(1\ 2)$ and $(3\ 4)$. Is the permutation module for $G$ over $F$ isomorphic to the regular $FG$-module?

Let $G = \langle (1\ 2), (3\ 4) \rangle \le S_4$. These two permutations are disjoint transpositions, so they commute and each has order 2. Hence,

$$G \cong \Bbb{Z}_2 \times \Bbb{Z}_2$$

So $|G| = 4$ and $G = \{ e, (1\ 2), (3\ 4), (1\ 2)(3\ 4) \}$.

Let $F$ be a field and consider the permutation module $V = F^X$, where $X = G$ with the left action of $G$ on itself by multiplication. This is exactly the regular representation.

A permutation module for G over a ring R is an RG-module that has a basis that is invariant under the action of G. This means that the group elements "shuffle" the basis vectors but don't change the underlying set of vectors
# 6.

Let $G = C_2 = \langle x : x^2 = 1 \rangle$.
(a) Show that the function
$$\psi: \alpha \cdot 1 + \beta \cdot x \mapsto (\alpha + \beta)(1 - x) \quad (\alpha, \beta \in F)$$
is an $FG$-homomorphism from the regular $FG$-module to itself.

- $F$-linearity: clear from the definition.
- $G$-equivariance:

Let $g = x$, and compute $\psi(x \cdot (\alpha \cdot 1 + \beta \cdot x))$:

$$x \cdot (\alpha \cdot 1 + \beta \cdot x) = \alpha x + \beta$$

So, $\psi(x \cdot v) = \psi(\beta + \alpha x) = (\beta + \alpha)(1 - x)$.

  
Compare with:

$$x \cdot \psi(v) = x \cdot \left( (\alpha + \beta)(1 - x) \right) = (\alpha + \beta)(x - x^2) = (\alpha + \beta)(x - 1) = -(\alpha + \beta)(1 - x).$$For $\psi$ to be a homomorphism, we need $\psi(x \cdot v) = x \cdot \psi(v)$, so$$(\alpha + \beta)(1 - x) = -(\alpha + \beta)(1 - x).$$

This implies $2(\alpha + \beta)(1 - x) = 0$. If we choose $\alpha = 1, \beta = 0$, then $2(1 - x) = 0$, which means $2 = 0$ in $F$, so $\operatorname{char} F = 2$.

  
Conclusion:

$\psi$ is an $FG$-homomorphism if and only if $\operatorname{char} F = 2$.
(b) Prove that $\psi^2 = 2\psi$.
(c) Find a basis $B$ of $FG$ such that
$$[\psi]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
