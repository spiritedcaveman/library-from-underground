Let $U, V,$ and $W$ be $FG$-modules, and let $\psi: U \to V$ and $\phi: V \to W$ be $FG$-homomorphisms. Prove that $\phi \circ \psi: U \to W$ is an $FG$-homomorphism.

# 2.

Let $G$ be the subgroup of $S_5$ which is generated by $(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)$. Prove that the permutation module for $G$ over $F$ is isomorphic to the regular $FG$-module.

# 3.

Assume that $V$ is an $FG$-module. Prove that the subset
$$V^G = \{ v \in V : vg = v \text{ for all } g \in G \}$$is an $FG$-submodule of $V$. Show that the function$$\psi: v \mapsto \sum_{g \in G} vg \quad (v \in V)$$
is an $FG$-homomorphism from $V$ to $V^G$. Is it necessarily surjective?

# 4.

Suppose that $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic $FG$-modules. Define the $FG$-submodules $V^G$ and $W^G$ of $V$ and $W$ as in Exercise 3. Prove that $V^G$ and $W^G$ are isomorphic $FG$-module

Let $G$ be the subgroup of $S_4$ which is generated by $(1\ 2)$ and $(3\ 4)$. Is the permutation module for $G$ over $F$ isomorphic to the regular $FG$-module?

Let $G = C_2 = \langle x : x^2 = 1 \rangle$.
(a) Show that the function
$$\psi: \alpha \cdot 1 + \beta \cdot x \mapsto (\alpha + \beta)(1 - x) \quad (\alpha, \beta \in F)$$
is an $FG$-homomorphism from the regular $FG$-module to itself.
(b) Prove that $\psi^2 = 2\psi$.
(c) Find a basis $B$ of $FG$ such that
$$[\psi]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
