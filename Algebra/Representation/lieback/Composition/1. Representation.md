If the action map (the group representation) doesn't allow the whole space to be spanned by eigenvectors — meaning the representation is **not diagonalizable** or the module isn't semisimple — then you're dealing with more complex structure, where the representation isn't fully reducible in a straightforward way.

When you're looking at equivalence of representations, it's crucial to remember that **equivalent representations** still preserve the overall structure, even if it's not as simple as diagonalization. If a representation is reducible, then **any equivalent representation will also have a reducible structure**, but the situation can get complicated if the representation is more intricate (e.g., non-diagonalizable or has non-trivial Jordan blocks).

If the eigenvectors don’t span the whole space (i.e., the representation has non-trivial Jordan blocks or is not diagonalizable), then the space is still decomposable into invariant subspaces, just in a less straightforward way. **Equivalence** preserves these more complicated structures: you’ll still be able to find equivalent subspaces that describe the same invariance under the group action, but they may not come in the form of simple eigenspaces.

Thus, if one representation has a nontrivial Jordan form (not diagonalizable), so will any equivalent representation — it’s just that we may not be able to find a "nice" decomposition (like a direct sum of eigenspaces) in that case.

So while we can't always say exactly how the invariant subspaces will look (beyond the direct sum case), **equivalence preserves the overall module structure**. This means we cannot find an equivalent representation that would “simplify” the structure of a reducible representation in a way that makes it non-reducible.
