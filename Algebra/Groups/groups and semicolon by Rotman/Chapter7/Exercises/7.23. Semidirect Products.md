Show that the group $Q_{2^n}$ of generalized quaternions is not a semidirect product.



# 7.24.
 If $|G|=mn$, where $(m,n) = 1$, and if $K \triangleleft G$ has order $m$, then a subgroup $Q \le G$ is a complement of $K$ if and only if $|Q|= n$.
 
 

# 7.25.
If $k$ is a field, then $GL(n, k)$ is a semidirect product of $SL(n, k)$ by $k^\times$, where $k^\times = k - \{0\}$.



# 7.26.
If $M$ is the group of all motions of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $M$ is a semidirect product of $Tr(n, \mathbb{R})$ by $O(n, \mathbb{R})$.



# 7.27.
 If $K$ and $Q$ are solvable, then $K \rtimes_\theta Q$ is also solvable.



# 7.28.
 Show that $K \rtimes_\theta Q$ is the direct product $K \times Q$ if and only if $\theta: Q \to \text{Aut}(K)$ is trivial (that is, $\theta_x = 1$ for all $x \in Q$).



# 7.29.
 If $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, construct all semidirect products of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ by $\mathbb{Z}_q$, and compare your results to Theorem 4.20. (The condition $q|p - 1$ in that theorem should now be more understandable.)
