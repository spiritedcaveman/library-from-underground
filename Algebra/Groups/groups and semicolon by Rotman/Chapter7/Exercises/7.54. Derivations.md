If $G = Ken every transversal $l: Q \to G$ has the form $l(x) = (d(x), x)$ for some $d(x) \in K$. Show that $l$ is a homomorphism if and only if $d$ is a derivation.|



# 7.55.
Give an example of a derivation $d: Q \to K$ whose kernel is not a normal subgroup of $Q$.



# 7.56.
 If $\theta: Q \to \text{Aut}(K)$ is trivial, then $H^1(Q, K) = \text{Hom}(Q, K)$. Conclude that if $B$ is an abelian group, then $H^1(B, \mathbb{C}^\times) = B^*$, the character group of $B$.



# 7.57
Regard the elements of an extension $G$ realizing data $(Q, K, \theta)$ as ordered pairs $(a, x) \in K \times Q$, let $l: Q \to G$ be the transversal $l(x) = (0, x)$, and let $f: Q \times Q \to K$ be the corresponding factor set. If $d: G \to K$ is Gruenberg's derivation, show that $d(a, x) = na + \sum_{y \in Q} f(x, y)$, where $n = |Q|$.

 Let $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \langle a \rangle$, let $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \langle x \rangle$, and define an action $\theta$ of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $\mathbb{Z}_3$ by $a^x = a^{-1}$. Show that $H^1(\mathbb{Z}_2, \mathbb{Z}_3, \theta) = 0$. (Hint. $S_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $\text{Aut}(S_3)/\text{Inn}(S_3) = 1$.)
7.59. Let $\phi: G \to G$ be a homomorphism, and let $G$ act on itself by conjugation: if $g, x \in G$, then $g^x = xgx^{-1}$. Show that $d: G \to G$, defined by $d(g) = g \phi(g)^{-1}$, satisfies the equation
$$ d(gg') = d(g')^g d(g). $$
(Thus, $d$ would be a derivation if $G$ were abelian. This function $d$ has already arisen in Exercise 1.50 and in the proof of Theorem 7.33.)
