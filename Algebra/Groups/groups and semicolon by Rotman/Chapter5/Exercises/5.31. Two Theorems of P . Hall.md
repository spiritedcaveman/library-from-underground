# 5.31.
 If $G$ is a finite (not necessarily solvable) group and $H$ is a normal Hall subgroup, then $H \text{ char } G$.
 
# 5.32.
(i) If $G$ is a finite solvable group, then for every set of primes $\pi$, a maximal $\pi$-subgroup is a Hall $\pi$-subgroup.
(ii) Let $\pi = \{3, 5\}$. Show that both $Z_3$ and $Z_5$ are maximal $\pi$-subgroups of $S_5$. Conclude, when $G$ is not solvable, that maximal $\pi$-subgroups may not be isomorphic and hence may not be conjugate.
(iii) If $\pi = \{2, 5\}$, then a maximal $\pi$-subgroup of $S_5$ is not a Hall $\pi$-subgroup. (Hint. Exercise 3.25.)

**Definition.** If $\pi$ is a set of primes, define $O_\pi(G)$ to be the subgroup of $G$ generated by all the normal $\pi$-subgroups of $G$.

# 5.33.
Show that $O_\pi(G)$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$.

# 5.34
Show that $O_\pi(G)$ is the intersection of all the maximal $\pi$-subgroups of $G$.
