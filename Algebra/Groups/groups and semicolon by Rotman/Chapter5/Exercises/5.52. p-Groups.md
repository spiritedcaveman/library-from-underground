**(Wielandt).** A finite group $G$ is nilpotent if and only if $G' \le \Phi(G)$.
Proof.

Suppose first that $G$ is nilpotent. Then every maximal subgroup of $G$ is normal and of prime power index, and the Frattini subgroup $\Phi(G)$, defined as the intersection of all maximal subgroups, satisfies the property that $G/\Phi(G)$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group. In particular, this quotient is abelian, hence the commutator subgroup $G'$, which is the smallest normal subgroup with abelian quotient, must lie in $\Phi(G)$. Thus, $G' \le \Phi(G)$.

Conversely, suppose $G' \le \Phi(G)$. Then the quotient $G/\Phi(G)$ is abelian, and since $\Phi(G)$ is a characteristic subgroup and hence normal, we can consider a generating set for $G/\Phi(G)$ which lifts to a generating set for $G$. As a result, all maximal subgroups contain $G'$, and since $G' \le M$ for all maximal subgroups $M$, it follows that all such subgroups are normal. This condition implies that $G$ is nilpotent, since in a finite group, normality of all maximal subgroups characterizes nilpotency. Therefore, $G$ is nilpotent if and only if $G' \le \Phi(G)$.

 If $G$ is a finite $p$-group, then $G$ is cyclic if and only if $G/\Phi(G)$ is cyclic.
 Proof.
 If $G$ is cyclic, then any maximal subgroup is unique and of index $p$, hence $\Phi(G)$ is that subgroup. So $G/\Phi(G) \cong C_p$, hence cyclic.

Conversely, if $G/\Phi(G)$ is cyclic, say generated by $g\Phi(G)$, then $G = \langle g, \Phi(G) \rangle$. But in $p$-groups, $\Phi(G)$ consists of non-generators. So $g$ alone generates $G$, hence $G$ is cyclic.

**Definition.** A finite $p$-group $G$ is **extra-special** if $Z(G)$ is cyclic and $\Phi(G) = Z(G) = G'$.


# 5.55
 If $G$ is extra-special, then $G/Z(G)$ is an elementary abelian group.
 
# 5.56
Every nonabelian group of order $p^3$ is extra-special.
