# 4.1. 
Let $H < G$. If both $H$ and $G/H$ are $p$-groups, then $G$ is a $p$-group.


# 4.2.
If $|G| = p^n$, where $p$ is prime, and if $0 \le k \le n$, then $G$ contains a normal subgroup of order $p^k$.


# 4.3.
 Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group, and let $H$ be a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$. Prove that $H \cap Z(G) \neq 1$.
 

# 4.4
 Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group; show that if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ having order $p$, then $H \le Z(G)$.

# 4.5.
Let $H$ be a proper subgroup of a finite $p$-group $G$. If $|H| = p^s$, then there is a subgroup of order $p^{s+1}$ containing $H$.

# 4.6.
Let $p$ be a prime, let $G$ be a finite group whose order is divisible by $p$, and assume that $P \le G$ is a maximal $p$-subgroup (if $Q \le G$ is a $p$-subgroup and $P \le Q$, then $P = Q$).

(i) Every conjugate of $P$ is also a maximal $p$-subgroup.
(ii) If $P$ is the only maximal $p$-subgroup of $G$, then $P \triangleleft G$.


# 4.7.
 If $p$ is a prime and $G$ is a nonabelian group of order $p^3$, then $|Z(G)| = p$, $G/Z(G) \cong Z_p \times Z_p$, and $Z(G) = G'$, the commutator subgroup.
 
Proof.
Let $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $p^3$, with $p$ prime. Then possible orders for $Z(G)$ are $p$, $p^2$, or $p^3$.

- If $|Z(G)| = p^3$, then $Z(G) = G$, so $G$ is abelian — contradiction.
- If $|Z(G)| = p^2$, then $|G/Z(G)| = p$, which is cyclic. But then $G$ itself is abelian — again contradiction.
Therefore, $|Z(G)| = p$ is the only possibility.
So $|G/Z(G)| = p^2$, and since $G$ is nonabelian, $G/Z(G)$ is not cyclic. Hence:
$$G/Z(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p.$$Now, since $G/Z(G)$ is abelian, we know that $G' \subseteq Z(G)$. But $G$ is nonabelian, so $G' \ne \{1\}$, hence $|G'| \geq p$. Also $|Z(G)| = p$, so:$$G' = Z(G).$$

# 4.8.
Prove that the number of normal subgroups of order $p^3$ of a finite $p$-group $G$ is congruent to $1 \pmod{p}$.

Proof.

Let $G$ act on the set $\mathcal{S}$ of subgroups of order $p^3$ by conjugation:

$$g \cdot H = gHg^{-1}$$

This action partitions $\mathcal{S}$ into orbits. A subgroup $H \in \mathcal{S}$ is normal if and only if its orbit is a singleton (i.e., $gHg^{-1} = H$ for all $g \in G$), meaning it is fixed under the action.

So, the number of normal subgroups of order $p^3$ is equal to the number of fixed points under the action.

Now, by Burnside’s Lemma (the Cauchy-Frobenius formula):

$$\text{Number of orbits} = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \text{Fix}(g)$$

But we don’t need the full lemma. Since $G$ is a $p$-group, the number of orbits of size not divisible by $p$ is congruent to the number of fixed points modulo $p$.

Indeed, in a finite $p$-group acting on a finite set, the number of fixed points is congruent to the total number of elements modulo $p$.

So, let $X$ be the set of subgroups of order $p^3$ in $G$, and let $n$ be the number of normal subgroups among them. Then:

$$|X| \equiv n \pmod{p}$$

But by known facts in $p$-group theory, the total number $|X| \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ (e.g., via counting subgroups of given order — it’s a classical result that the number of subgroups of order $p^k$ in a finite $p$-group is $\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$).

Hence:

$$n \equiv |X| \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$

Therefore, the number of normal subgroups of order $p^3$ is congruent to $1 \pmod{p}$.
