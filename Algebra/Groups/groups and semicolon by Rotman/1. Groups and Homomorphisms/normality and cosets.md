Statement:
Let $H \leq G$. In general, a left coset $Hx$ and a right coset $xH$ are not equal unless $x \in N_G(H)$, the normaliser of $H$ in $G$.
Moreover:

If $H$ is not normal in $G$, then there exist elements $x \in G$ such that $Hx \ne xH$.
For any $x_1, x_2 \in G$, even if the sets $Hx_1$ and $x_2H$ happen to be equal as sets, this does not imply $H$ is normal.
In general, left and right cosets are not comparable unless $H$ is normal, because the set-theoretic coincidence $Hx = xH$ implies $x \in N_G(H)$.
