 Show that an $r$-cycle is an even permutation if and only if $r$ is odd.

# 1.20.
 Compute $\operatorname{sgn}(\alpha)$ for $\alpha = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

# 1.21.
 Show that $S_n$ has the same number of even permutations as of odd permutations. (Hint. If $\tau = (1 \ 2)$, consider the function $f: S_n \to S_n$ defined by $f(\alpha) = \tau\alpha$.)

# 1.22.
 Let $\alpha, \beta \in S_n$. If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the same parity, then $\alpha\beta$ is even; if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have distinct parity, then $\alpha\beta$ is odd.
