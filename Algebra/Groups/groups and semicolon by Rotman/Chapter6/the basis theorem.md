Let $\{x_1, \dots, x_r\}$ be an independent subset of a $p$-primary abelian group $G$.

(i) If $\{z_1, \dots, z_r\} \subset G$, where $pz_i = x_i$ for all $i$, then $\{z_1, \dots, z_r\}$ is independent.

(ii) If $k_1, \dots, k_r$ are integers with $k_i x_i \ne 0$ for all $i$, then $\{k_1 x_1, \dots, k_r x_r\}$ is also independent.


(i) Suppose $\sum a_i z_i = 0$ with $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$. Apply $P$ to both sides: $P\left(\sum a_i z_i\right) = \sum a_i Pz_i = \sum a_i x_i = 0$. Since $\{x_i\}$ is independent, all $a_i = 0$, so $\{z_i\}$ is independent.

(ii) Suppose $\sum a_i k_i x_i = 0$. Then $\sum (a_i k_i) x_i = 0$, and again since $\{x_i\}$ is independent, all $a_i k_i = 0$. But $k_i x_i \ne 0$ implies $k_i \ne 0$ in the torsion setting, so $a_i = 0$. Thus $\{k_i x_i\}$ is independent.


If $G$ is an abelian group and $m \leq 0$ is an integer, then $$mG = \{ mx: x \in G \} \leq G$$
$\mu_m: G \to G$ by $x \mapsto mx$ is homomorphism and denote $\operatorname{ker} \mu_m$ by $G[m]$
