In each of the following cases, let $T$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is represented by the matrix $A$ in the standard ordered basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$, and let $U$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{C}^2$ represented by $A$ in the standard ordered basis. Find the characteristic polynomial for $T$ and that for $U$, find the characteristic values of each operator, and for each such characteristic value $c$ find a basis for the corresponding space of characteristic vectors.
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$


Case 1:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
Characteristic polynomial: $(\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 0) = \lambda(\lambda - 1)$
Eigenvalues (real & complex): $\lambda = 0, 1$
Eigenspaces:
For $\lambda = 1$: $\ker\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \text{span}\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$
For $\lambda = 0$: $\ker\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \text{span}\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$

Case 2:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Characteristic polynomial: $\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 5$
Eigenvalues: $\lambda = \frac{3 \pm i\sqrt{11}}{2}$ (complex)
For $\lambda = \frac{3 + i\sqrt{11}}{2}$:
Solve $(A - \lambda I)x = 0$, gives 1D space.
Basis: Any nonzero vector in the null space of $A - \lambda I$.
E.g., eigenvector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{11}}{6} \end{pmatrix}$
Only defined over $\mathbb{C}^2$ â€” no real eigenvalues/eigenvectors.

Case 3:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Characteristic polynomial: $(\lambda - 2)(\lambda - 0) = \lambda(\lambda - 2)$
Eigenvalues: $\lambda = 0, 2$
Eigenspaces:
For $\lambda = 2$: $A - 2I = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \implies \ker = \text{span}\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$
For $\lambda = 0$: $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \implies \ker = \text{span}\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$
Same for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2$.

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ triangular matrix over the field $F$. Prove that the characteristic values of $A$ are the diagonal entries of $A$, i.e., the scalars $A_{ii}$.

Soln.
Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ triangular matrix over a field $F$. Then $A - \lambda I$ is also triangular, with diagonal entries $A_{ii} - \lambda$. Since the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries,
$$\det(A - \lambda I) = \prod_{i=1}^n (A_{ii} - \lambda).$$
Thus, the characteristic polynomial is $\chi_A(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^n (\lambda - A_{ii})$, and the characteristic values are precisely the diagonal entries $A_{ii}$.

Let $T$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} -9 & 4 & 4 \\ -8 & 3 & 4 \\ -16 & 8 & 7 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Prove that $T$ is diagonalizable by exhibiting a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$, each vector of which is a characteristic vector of $T$.
Soln.

We begin by computing the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $A$. We find the determinant of $A - \lambda I$:
$$\det(A - \lambda I) = \begin{vmatrix} -9 - \lambda & 4 & 4 \\ -8 & 3 - \lambda & 4 \\ -16 & 8 & 7 - \lambda \end{vmatrix}.$$
$$(\lambda + 1)^2 (\lambda - 3)$$
The eigenvalues are $\lambda = -1$ (algebraic multiplicity 2), and $\lambda = 3$ (multiplicity 1). We now find eigenspaces.

For $\lambda = -1$, we compute $\ker(A + I)$.
$$A + I = \begin{pmatrix} -8 & 4 & 4 \\ -8 & 4 & 4 \\ -16 & 8 & 8 \end{pmatrix}.$$
The rows are linearly dependent (row 2 = row 1, row 3 = 2 $\times$ row 1), so the rank is 1, and the nullity is $3 - 1 = 2$. The eigenspace is given by $-8x + 4y + 4z = 0$, or $-2x + y + z = 0$, which means $y = 2x - z$. The eigenvectors are of the form $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x - z \\ z \end{pmatrix} = x \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + z \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
A basis for the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda = -1$ is $\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$.


The system is $3x - y - z = 0$ and $-\frac{8}{3}y + \frac{4}{3}z = 0 \Rightarrow 2y = z$. Substituting into the first equation: $3x - y - 2y = 0 \Rightarrow 3x = 3y \Rightarrow x = y$.
So the eigenvectors are of the form $\begin{pmatrix} y \\ y \\ 2y \end{pmatrix} = y \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$.
A basis for the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda = 3$ is $\left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\}$.

We have found three linearly independent eigenvectors: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$. These form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of characteristic vectors of $T$. Therefore, $T$ is diagonalizable.

Let
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & -3 & -2 \\ 4 & -1 & -2 \\ 10 & -5 & -3 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Is $A$ similar over the field $\mathbb{R}$ to a diagonal matrix? Is $A$ similar over the field $\mathbb{C}$ to a diagonal matrix?

Soln.

To determine if $A$ is similar to a diagonal matrix over $\mathbb{R}$ and over $\mathbb{C}$, we compute the characteristic polynomial and its roots (eigenvalues), then examine the eigenspaces.
Compute $\det(A - \lambda I)$:
$$\det\begin{pmatrix} 6 - \lambda & -3 & -2 \\ 4 & -1 - \lambda & -2 \\ 10 & -5 & -3 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}.$$Expanding along the first row:$$(6 - \lambda)\begin{vmatrix} -1 - \lambda & -2 \\ -5 & -3 - \lambda \end{vmatrix}
+ 3\begin{vmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ 10 & -3 - \lambda \end{vmatrix}
- 2\begin{vmatrix} 4 & -1 - \lambda \\ 10 & -5 \end{vmatrix}.$$
The roots of the characteristic polynomial are the eigenvalues. Over $\mathbb{C}$, the roots are $\lambda = 2, i, -i$, which are three distinct eigenvalues. Therefore, $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$.

Over $\mathbb{R}$, the eigenvalues are $\lambda = 2$ (real) and the quadratic factor $\lambda^2 + 1$ has no real roots. For $A$ to be diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$, we would need 3 linearly independent real eigenvectors. Since there are only one real eigenvalue, we can find at most one linearly independent real eigenvector (up to scalar multiple) for $\lambda = 2$. Thus, $A$ is not diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{A \text{ is similar over } \mathbb{C} \text{ to a diagonal matrix, but not over } \mathbb{R}.}$

Let $T$ be the linear operator on $\mathbb{R}^4$ which is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix
$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & b & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & c \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Under what conditions on $a, b, c$ is $T$ diagonalizable?

# 7.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on the $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, and suppose that $T$ has $n$ distinct characteristic values. Prove that $T$ is diagonalizable.

Soln.
If $T$ has $n$ distinct characteristic values (i.e., eigenvalues), then for each eigenvalue $\lambda_i$, the algebraic multiplicity is 1.
Each distinct eigenvalue gives rise to an eigenvector, and eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. So we get $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors.
Hence, these eigenvectors form a basis of $V$, and $T$ is diagonalizable.

Let $A$ and $B$ be $n \times n$ matrices over the field $F$. Prove that if $(I - AB)$ is invertible, then $(I - BA)$ is invertible and
$$(I - BA)^{-1} = I + B(I - AB)^{-1}A.$$
We know that $AB$ and $BA$ has the same eigenvalues, and Since $I+AB$ invertible $-1$ is not an eigenvalue for $I+AB$ since if $-1$ is an eigenvalue then $I+AB$ is singular which is a contradiction. and since $AB$ and $BA$ has the same eigenvalues then $-1$ is also not an eigenvalue for $I+BA$ therefore $I+BA$ is also invertible.

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
(I + BA)(1 - B (1 + AB)^{-1}A) &=& I + BA - B(I + AB)^{-1}A - BAB(I + AB)^{-1}A \\
&=& I + BA - B((I+AB)(I+AB)^{-1})A \\
&=& I + BA - BIA \\
&=& I + BA - BA \\
&=& I

Use the result of Exercise 8 to prove that, if $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices over the field $F$, then $AB$ and $BA$ have precisely the same characteristic values in $F$.

Soln.
Let $\lambda \in F$, and suppose $\lambda \ne 0$. Consider the matrix $I - \frac{1}{\lambda} AB$. If it is invertible, then so is $$I - \frac{1}{\lambda} BA,$$by the identity: $$(I - BA)^{-1} = I + B(I - AB)^{-1}A.$$This shows that $I - \frac{1}{\lambda} AB$ is invertible $\iff I - \frac{1}{\lambda} BA$ is invertible, which implies: $$\det\left(I - \frac{1}{\lambda} AB\right) = 0 \quad \iff \quad \det\left(I - \frac{1}{\lambda} BA\right) = 0.$$This is equivalent to: $$\det(AB - \lambda I) = 0 \quad \iff \quad \det(BA - \lambda I) = 0 \quad \text{for } \lambda \ne 0.$$Now for $\lambda = 0$, we note: $$\ker(AB) \cong \ker(BA) \quad \text{(they have same nullity)},$$and hence the algebraic multiplicity of 0 as an eigenvalue (i.e., the dimension of the null space) is the same. So $AB$ and $BA$ have the same characteristic polynomial, hence the same characteristic values in $F$.

Suppose that $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with real entries which is symmetric ($A^t = A$). Prove that $A$ is similar over $\mathbb{R}$ to a diagonal matrix.

Soln.

 Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be symmetric: $A=A^\top$. Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^n \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}$ such that $A\mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}$. Then: $$\lambda \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \langle \lambda \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \langle A\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, A\mathbf{v} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, \lambda \mathbf{v} \rangle = \overline{\lambda} \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle.$$Since $\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{v} \rangle > 0$, we conclude $\lambda = \overline{\lambda}$, so $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.

Let $A \in M_2(\mathbb{R})$ be a real symmetric matrix, i.e., $A^T = A$. We want to show that $A$ is similar over $\mathbb{R}$ to a diagonal matrix.

Since $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, the Spectral Theorem applies: any real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$, and all its eigenvalues are real. Thus, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ has real coefficients and real roots. So $A$ has two real eigenvalues (possibly equal), say $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$.

Let $v_1$ be a real eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda_1$. Since $A$ is symmetric, the orthogonal complement $v_1^\perp$ is $A$-invariant, and $A$ restricted to $v_1^\perp$ (a 1-dimensional subspace) has a real eigenvector $v_2$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_2$. Hence, $A$ has a real basis of eigenvectors.

Thus, $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$, with real eigenvalues and an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Therefore, $A$ is similar over $\mathbb{R}$ to the diagonal matrix $\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$.

Let $N$ be a $2 \times 2$ complex matrix such that $N^2 = 0$. Prove that either $N = 0$ or $N$ is similar over $\mathbb{C}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
   
Soln. Let $N \in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ and suppose $N^2 = 0$. Then $N$ is nilpotent, so its only eigenvalue is $0$, and its minimal polynomial divides $x^2$. The Jordan canonical form over $\mathbb{C}$ must then consist only of Jordan blocks for eigenvalue $0$.
In dimension 2, there are only two possibilities:
1.  The minimal polynomial is $x \implies N$ is diagonalizable and nilpotent $\implies N = 0$.
2.  The minimal polynomial is $x^2 \implies N \ne 0$, and $N$ is similar to
$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
This matrix is similar to $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
via conjugation by
$$P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Conclusion: Either $N = 0$, or $N \sim \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.    

# 12.

Use the result of Exercise 11 to prove the following: If $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with complex entries, then $A$ is similar over $\mathbb{C}$ to a matrix of one of the two types
$$\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 1 & a \end{pmatrix}.$$

Soln.
Let $A \in M_2(\mathbb{C})$. Since $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed, $A$ has a Jordan canonical form over $\mathbb{C}$. The Jordan canonical form is determined by the eigenvalues and the sizes of the Jordan blocks. There are two cases:

1.  If $A$ has two distinct eigenvalues $a \ne b$, then $A$ is diagonalizable and similar to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix}$.

2.  If $A$ has a repeated eigenvalue $a$, then the minimal polynomial divides $(x - a)^2$.
* If the minimal polynomial is $x - a$, then $A$ is diagonalizable and similar to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}$.
* If the minimal polynomial is $(x - a)^2$, then $A$ is not diagonalizable, and the Jordan canonical form consists of a single Jordan block of size 2 for eigenvalue $a$, which is $\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}$. This is similar to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 1 & a \end{pmatrix}$ via conjugation by $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

Let $V$ be the vector space of all functions from $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$ which are continuous, i.e., the space of continuous real-valued functions on the real line. Let $T$ be the linear operator on $V$ defined by
$$(Tf)(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt.$$
Prove that $T$ has no characteristic values.

Soln.

Suppose, for contradiction, that $T$ has a characteristic value $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. Then there exists a nonzero $f \in V$ such that$$Tf = \lambda f, \quad \text{i.e.,} \quad \int_0^x f(t) \, dt = \lambda f(x) \quad \text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}.$$
Since $f$ is continuous, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus implies that $\int_0^x f(t) \, dt$ is differentiable. Thus, $\lambda f(x)$ must also be differentiable, which implies $f(x)$ is differentiable (since $\lambda \ne 0$; if $\lambda = 0$, then $\int_0^x f(t) dt = 0$ for all $x$, implying $f(x) = 0$, a contradiction).
Differentiate both sides:
$$\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_0^x f(t) \, dt \right) = \frac{d}{dx} (\lambda f(x))$$
$$\Rightarrow f(x) = \lambda f'(x).$$So $f'(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} f(x)$, a first-order linear ODE. The general solution is$$f(x) = C e^{x/\lambda}$$for some constant $C$. Substituting into the original equation:$$\int_0^x C e^{t/\lambda} \, dt = \lambda C e^{x/\lambda}.$$Compute the integral:$$\int_0^x e^{t/\lambda} dt = \lambda \left[ e^{t/\lambda} \right]_0^x = \lambda (e^{x/\lambda} - e^0) = \lambda (e^{x/\lambda} - 1),$$so$$\lambda C (e^{x/\lambda} - 1) = \lambda C e^{x/\lambda}.$$Since we assumed $\lambda \ne 0$, we can divide by $\lambda$:$$C (e^{x/\lambda} - 1) = C e^{x/\lambda}.$$This simplifies to:$$C e^{x/\lambda} - C = C e^{x/\lambda} \Rightarrow -C = 0 \Rightarrow C = 0.$$
So $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which means $f = 0$, contradicting the assumption that $f \ne 0$.
Hence, there is no nonzero $f$ such that $Tf = \lambda f$. That is, $T$ has no characteristic values.
