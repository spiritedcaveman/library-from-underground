Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. What is the minimal polynomial for the identity operator on $V$? What is the minimal polynomial for the zero operator?

Let $a, b, c$ be elements of a field $F$, and let $A$ be the following $3 \times 3$ matrix over $F$:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & c \\ 1 & 0 & b \\ 0 & 1 & a \end{pmatrix}.$$
Prove that the characteristic polynomial for $A$ is $x^3 - ax^2 - bx - c$ and that this is also the minimal polynomial for $A$.

Soln.
We compute the characteristic polynomial $\chi_A(x) = \det(xI - A)$:
$$xI - A = \begin{pmatrix}
x & 0 & -c \\
-1 & x & -b \\
0 & -1 & x - a
\end{pmatrix}.$$

Now, since $A$ is a companion matrix of the monic polynomial $x^3 - ax^2 - bx - c$, its minimal polynomial is the same as its characteristic polynomial, because no polynomial of lower degree annihilates $A$.

Let $A$ be the $4 \times 4$ real matrix
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Show that the characteristic polynomial for $A$ is $x^2(x - 1)^2$ and that it is also the minimal polynomial.

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space and let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. Suppose that there exists some positive integer $k$ so that $T^k = 0$. Prove that $T^n = 0$.
Soln.
Let $T: V \to V$ be a linear operator on an $n$-dimensional vector space such that $T^k = 0$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose $T^n \ne 0$. Then there exists $x \in V$ such that $T^n x \ne 0$, contradicting $T^k = 0$ unless $k > n$. So assume $k \le n$. Pick $x \in V$ such that $T^{k-1}x \ne 0$ but $T^k x = 0$. Then the set $$\{x, Tx, T^2x, \dots, T^{k-1}x\}$$is linearly independent. So $k \le n$. But if there exists such a chain for some $x$, the largest such $k$ among all such chains is the index of nilpotency of $T$, and cannot exceed $n$. Since $T^k = 0$, all such chains have length at most $k$, so the maximal length is $\le k$. Thus the index of nilpotency is $\le n$, and hence $T^n = 0$.


here's the lowest-tech way i know of proving this. let k be the smallest positive integer such that T^k = 0. show that if 0 <= i < k, then ker T^i is properly contained in ker T^(i + 1). if k > n, then count the dimensions of the increasing chain of subspaces 0 < ker T < ker T^2 < ... to get a contradiction

Find a $3 \times 3$ matrix for which the minimal polynomial is $x^2$.

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $V$ be the space of polynomials over $\mathbb{R}$ which have degree at most $n$ (throw in the 0-polynomial). Let $D$ be the differentiation operator on $V$. What is the minimal polynomial for $D$?
   
   Soln.
   Let $V = \mathbb{R}_n[x]$, the space of real polynomials of degree at most $n$, and let $D: V \to V$ be the differentiation operator. Then $D^{n+1} = 0$, since the $(n+1)$-th derivative of any degree-$n$ polynomial is zero. But $D^n \ne 0$, as $D^n(x^n) = n! \ne 0$. Thus, the minimal polynomial of $D$ is $$\mu_D(x) = x^{n+1}.$$

Let $P$ be the operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which projects each vector onto the $z$-axis, parallel to the $xy$-plane: $P(x, y, z) = (0, 0, z)$. Show that $P$ is linear. What is the minimal polynomial for $P$?
   
   Soln. 
   this is projection map, so an idempotent the characteristic values are $0, 1$
   
   $$\mu P​(x) = x^2−x = x(x−1)$$

   Let $A$ and $B$ be $n \times n$ matrices over the field $F$. Prove that if $(I - AB)$ is invertible, then $(I - BA)$ is invertible and
$$(I - BA)^{-1} = I + B(I - AB)^{-1}A.$$

10. Let $N$ be a $2 \times 2$ complex matrix such that $N^2 = 0$. Prove that either $N = 0$ or $N$ is similar over $\mathbb{C}$ to $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.


Soln.

Let $N \in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ and suppose $N^2 = 0$. Then $N$ is nilpotent, so its only eigenvalue is $0$, and its minimal polynomial divides $x^2$. The Jordan canonical form over $\mathbb{C}$ must then consist only of Jordan blocks for eigenvalue $0$.
In dimension 2, there are only two possibilities:

1.  The minimal polynomial is $x \implies N$ is diagonalizable and nilpotent $\implies N = 0$.
2.  The minimal polynomial is $x^2 \implies N \ne 0$, and $N$ is similar to
$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$
This matrix is similar to $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
via conjugation by
$$P = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Conclusion: Either $N = 0$, or $N \sim \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.


# 12.
Use the result of Exercise 11 to prove the following: If $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix with complex entries, then $A$ is similar over $\mathbb{C}$ to a matrix of one of the two types
$$\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 1 & a \end{pmatrix}.$$

Soln.
Let $A \in M_2(\mathbb{C})$. Since $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed, $A$ has a Jordan canonical form over $\mathbb{C}$. The Jordan canonical form is determined by the eigenvalues and the sizes of the Jordan blocks. There are two cases:

1.  If $A$ has two distinct eigenvalues $a \ne b$, then $A$ is diagonalizable and similar to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix}$.

2.  If $A$ has a repeated eigenvalue $a$, then the minimal polynomial divides $(x - a)^2$.
* If the minimal polynomial is $x - a$, then $A$ is diagonalizable and similar to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}$.
* If the minimal polynomial is $(x - a)^2$, then $A$ is not diagonalizable, and the Jordan canonical form consists of a single Jordan block of size 2 for eigenvalue $a$, which is $\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}$. This is similar to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 1 & a \end{pmatrix}$ via conjugation by $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
