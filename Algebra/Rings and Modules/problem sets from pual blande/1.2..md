Prove that the following are equivalent.
(a) The ideal $(p)$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is maximal.
(b) The ideal $(p)$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is prime.
(c) $p$ is a prime number.

Soln.

Let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then:

$(a) \Rightarrow (b)$: In any commutative ring, every maximal ideal is prime.
$(b) \Rightarrow (c)$: If $(p)$ is prime, then for $ab \in (p)$, we must have $a \in (p)$ or $b \in (p)$. This is equivalent to $p \mid ab \Rightarrow p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$, which is the defining property of prime numbers.
$(c) \Rightarrow (a)$: If $p$ is prime, then $\mathbb{Z}/(p) \cong \mathbb{F}_p$ is a field, hence $(p)$ is maximal.

Prove that $R$ is a division ring if and only if $0$ is a maximal right (left) ideal of $R$.

Soln.

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $R$ is a division ring. Then every nonzero element is invertible. Let $I$ be a right ideal with $0 \subsetneq I \subseteq R$. Let $a \in I$, $a \ne 0$. Then since $a$ is invertible, $1 = a a^{-1} \in I$, so $I = R$. Thus, $\{0\}$ is maximal.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $\{0\}$ is a maximal right ideal. Let $a \in R$, $a \ne 0$. Consider the right ideal $\langle a \rangle = \{ar : r \in R\}$. Since $a \ne 0$, $\langle a \rangle \ne \{0\}$, and hence by maximality, $\langle a \rangle = R$. So $1 \in \langle a \rangle$, i.e., there exists $r \in R$ such that $ar = 1$.
Now consider the right ideal $\langle r \rangle = \{rs : s \in R\}$. Again, $r \ne 0 \Rightarrow \langle r \rangle = R \Rightarrow \exists s \in R$ such that $rs = 1$. Then we have:
$$a = a \cdot 1 = a(rs) = (ar)s = 1 \cdot s = s,$$
so $a^{-1} = r$, showing $a$ is invertible.

Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
(a) If $\{p_\alpha\}_{\Delta}$ is a chain of prime ideals of $R$, prove that $\bigcup_{\Delta} p_\alpha$ and $\bigcap_{\Delta} p_\alpha$ are prime ideals of $R$.
Soln.
Let $\{p_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \Delta}$ be a chain (totally ordered by inclusion) of prime ideals in $R$.

**Intersection:** Let $P = \bigcap_{\alpha \in \Delta} p_\alpha$. If $ab \in P$, then $ab \in p_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. Since each $p_\alpha$ is prime, $a \in p_\alpha$ or $b \in p_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. Suppose $a \notin P$, i.e., $\exists \beta$ such that $a \notin p_\beta$. Then $b \in p_\beta$, so $b \in P$. Thus $P$ is prime.

**Union:** Let $Q = \bigcup_{\alpha \in \Delta} p_\alpha$. If $ab \in Q$, then $ab \in p_\gamma$ for some $\gamma$. Since $p_\gamma$ is prime, $a \in p_\gamma$ or $b \in p_\gamma$. WLOG, say $a \in p_\gamma \subseteq Q$, hence $a \in Q$. Thus $Q$ is prime.

(b) If $\{p_\alpha\}_{\Delta}$ is a family of prime ideals of $R$ that is not necessarily a chain, then must $\bigcap_{\Delta} p_\alpha$ be prime?
Soln.

Counterexample: Take $R = \mathbb{Z}$, and let $p = (2)$ and $q = (3)$. Both are prime ideals.
Then:
$$p \cap q = (2) \cap (3) = (6),$$
since $R = \mathbb{Z}$ is a PID and $\gcd(2,3) = 1$.
But $(6)$ is not prime: $2 \cdot 3 = 6 \in (6)$, but $2 \notin (6)$ and $3 \notin (6)$.

(c) Use Zorn's lemma going down to prove that $R$ has at least one minimal prime ideal.


(d) Prove that every prime ideal of $R$ contains a minimal prime ideal.
Soln.
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$. Consider the set
$$S := \{ Q \subseteq R \mid Q \text{ is a prime ideal with } Q \subseteq P \},$$
partially ordered by inclusion. Then $P \in S$, so $S \ne \emptyset$.
Let $\{Q_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a chain in $S$. Set $Q := \bigcap_{i \in I} Q_i$. Since the $Q_i$ form a chain of prime ideals, their intersection is prime (by part (a)). Also, $Q \subseteq P$, so $Q \in S$. Hence, every chain has a lower bound in $S$.
By Zorn's Lemma, $S$ has a minimal element, say $Q_{\min}$. Then $Q_{\min} \subseteq P$ is a prime ideal contained in $P$ and minimal among suchâ€”i.e., it is a minimal prime ideal contained in $P$.

(e) If $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is a family of ideals of $R$ and $p$ is a prime ideal of $R$ such that $A_1 A_2 \dots A_n \subseteq p$, prove that $p$ contains at least one of the $A_i$.

Soln.

Let $p$ be a prime ideal and $A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n \subseteq p$. Suppose for contradiction that $A_i \nsubseteq p$ for all $i$.
Then for each $i$, choose $a_i \in A_i$ with $a_i \notin p$. But $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n \in A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n \subseteq p$, so their product is in $p$, while none of the $a_i$ are in $p$.
This contradicts the definition of a prime ideal. Hence, for some $i$, $A_i \subseteq p$. 

(f) Use Zorn's lemma to show that every prime ideal of $R$ is contained in a maximal prime ideal of $R$. Can the same result be achieved by using Proposition 1.2.3 and Corollary 1.2.8? Conclude that if $p$ is a prime ideal of $R$ and $\bar{p}$ is a maximal prime ideal of $R$ containing $p$, then $\bar{p}$ is a maximal ideal of $R$.

Suppose that $R$ is a commutative ring. Show that the principal ideal generated by $X$ in the polynomial ring $R[X]$ is a prime (maximal) ideal of $R[X]$ if and only if $R$ is an integral domain (a field).
Soln.
Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Consider the ideal $(X) \subseteq R[X]$.

(1) $(X)$ is prime $\iff R$ is an integral domain:

Suppose $(X)$ is prime. Then $R[X]/(X) \cong R$. Since the quotient of a ring by a prime ideal is an integral domain, $R$ is an integral domain.
Conversely, if $R$ is an integral domain, then so is $R[X]$, and $(X)$ is prime since $R[X]/(X) \cong R$ is an integral domain.

(2) $(X)$ is maximal $\iff R$ is a field:

Suppose $(X)$ is maximal. Then $R[X]/(X) \cong R$ is a field, so $R$ is a field.
Conversely, if $R$ is a field, then $R[X]/(X) \cong R$ is a field, so $(X)$ is maximal.

# 8.
If $A$ is a right ideal of $R$, prove that $A^n$, $n \ge 1$, is a right ideal of $R$.

Soln.
Define
$$A^n := \text{the additive subgroup generated by all finite sums of the form } a_1 a_2 \dots a_n \text{ with } a_i \in A.$$
We show by induction that $A^n$ is a right ideal:

Base case ($n=1$): $A$ is a right ideal by assumption.

Inductive step: Suppose $A^n$ is a right ideal. Consider $A^{n+1} = A^n A = \text{span}\{xy \mid x \in A^n, y \in A\}$. This set is closed under addition by construction.
Now take any $z \in A^{n+1}$ and $r \in R$. Write $z = \sum_i x_i y_i$ with $x_i \in A^n$, $y_i \in A$. Then:
$$zr = \sum_i (x_i y_i)r = \sum_i x_i (y_i r) \in A^n A \quad \text{since } y_i r \in A.$$

If $R$ is a commutative ring and $I$ is an ideal of $R$, then $\sqrt{I} = \{a \in R \mid a^n \in I \text{ for some integer } n \ge 1 \}$ is called the [[radical]] of $I$.

(a) Prove that $\sqrt{I}$ is an ideal of $R$ such that $\sqrt{I} \supseteq I$.
Soln.
Let $a,b \in \sqrt{I}$, so $a^m, b^n \in I$ for some $m,n \ge 1$. Then
$$(a - b)^{m+n} = \sum_{k=0}^{m+n} \binom{m+n}{k} a^k (-b)^{m+n-k}.$$
Each term contains either $a^m$ or $b^n$ as a factor (since $k \ge m$ or $m+n-k \ge n$), so each term lies in $I$. Hence $(a-b)^{m+n} \in I$, so $a - b \in \sqrt{I}$.

For $r \in R$ and $a \in \sqrt{I}$ with $a^m \in I$,
$$(ra)^m = r^m a^m \in I,$$
so $ra \in \sqrt{I}$.

Since $I \subseteq \sqrt{I}$ by definition, $\sqrt{I}$ is an ideal containing $I$.


(b) An ideal $I$ is said to be a radical ideal if $\sqrt{I} = I$. Prove that every prime ideal of $R$ is a radical ideal.

Soln.
Let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$. Suppose $x^n \in P$ for some $x \in R$ and $n \ge 1$. We prove that $x \in P$ by induction on $n$:

Base case: If $n = 1$, then $x \in P$ trivially.
Inductive step: Assume $x^n \in P$ for some $n > 1$. Since $x^n = x \cdot x^{n-1} \in P$ and $P$ is prime, either $x \in P$ or $x^{n-1} \in P$. If $x \in P$ we're done. If $x^{n-1} \in P$, repeat the argument. Eventually, since $n$ is finite, this process terminates with $x \in P$.
Hence, $x^n \in P \implies x \in P$, so $\sqrt{P} \subseteq P$, and since $P \subseteq \sqrt{P}$ always, we get $\sqrt{P} = P$.
So every prime ideal is radical.

Counterexample to converse: 
 $I = (6) \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is radical because
$$\sqrt{(6)} = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x^n \in (6) \text{ for some } n \ge 1\} = (6),$$

# 10.
If $R$ is a commutative ring, does the set of all nilpotent elements of $R$ form an ideal of $R$?
Soln.

**The set of all nilpotent elements of a commutative ring $R$ forms an ideal, called the nilradical of $R$.
Let $N := \{x \in R \mid x^n = 0 \text{ for some } n \ge 1\}$.

Additive closure: If $x, y \in N$, then $x^m = 0$, $y^n = 0$ for some $m,n \ge 1$. In a commutative ring,
$$(x + y)^{m+n} = \sum_{k=0}^{m+n} \binom{m+n}{k} x^k y^{m+n-k},$$
and each term has $x^k = 0$ if $k \ge m$ or $y^{m+n-k} = 0$ if $m+n - k \ge n$, so every term is 0. Hence $(x + y)^{m+n} = 0 \Rightarrow x + y \in N$.

Absorption: If $x \in N$, $x^n = 0$, and $r \in R$, then $(rx)^n = r^n x^n = 0$ by commutativity. So $rx \in N$.

Therefore, $N$ is an ideal.


11. Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
(a) Prove that an ideal $p$ of $R$ is prime if and only if whenever $I_1$ and $I_2$ are ideals of $R$ such that $I_1 I_2 \subseteq p$, then either $I_1 \subseteq p$ or $I_2 \subseteq p$.
(b) If $R$ is a local ring with unique maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$, show that $\mathfrak{m}$ is the set of nonunits of $R$.
